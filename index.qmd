## Using AI in literature screening & review

- Locating resources: I still conduct the actual literature search manually to retain control over scope and quality, but use AI to refine and expand search keywords.
  - Databases to be consulted:
    - Google Scholar
    - Web of Science
    - Scopus
    - PsycINFO
  - AI usage: generate alternative search terms, synonyms, and related terminology that I might overlook.
  - Output: export search results into a structured table (CSV or BibTeX) containing author(s), year, and title.
- AI-assisted relevance screening

  The compiled table is then processed with AI to conduct a first-pass relevance check based on titles and abstracts, helping to prioritise which papers require closer reading.
  
- Structured reading of key papers

For selected core papers, I use tools such as NotebookLLM to focus reading around a fixed set of questions:
- Citation
- Research question
- Data and method
- Key findings (with respect to my research topic)
- Limitations and open issues

- Cross-paper comparison
AI is further used to compare papers across dimensions (e.g. theoretical assumptions, methods, findings), in order to identify recurring patterns, contradictions, and underexplored areas.


### Potential Reusable AI Prompts for Literature Screening & Review

#### Screening

**Relevance filtering (screening)**

Based on the abstract and keywords, assess whether this paper is highly relevant, potentially relevant, or not relevant to **[my research topic]**, and briefly justify your judgment.

请根据摘要和关键词，判断该论文与 **【我的研究主题】** 的相关性（高度相关 / 可能相关 / 不相关），并简要说明理由。

#### Single paper

**Information extraction**

Extract the following information from this article:  
1) Research question or main hypothesis  
2) Sample characteristics (language, participants, corpus size, etc.)  
3) Data and methodology  
4) Key findings relevant to my research topic  
5) Limitations and open questions acknowledged by the authors  


请从这篇文章中提取以下信息：  
1）研究问题或核心假设  
2）样本特征（语言、被试、语料规模等）  
3）数据与研究方法  
4）与我的研究主题最相关的主要结论  
5）作者明确指出的局限性或未解决问题  

**Concept clarification**
Explain the concept of **XXX** as it is used in **XXX research**, and clarify how it differs from closely related terms.

请解释 **XXX** 在 **XXX 研究领域** 中的含义，并说明它与相关或相近概念的区别。

**Critical reading support**

Identify any implicit assumptions in this paper that are not explicitly justified.

请指出这篇文章中存在但未被明确论证的隐含假设。

#### Multiple papers


**Cross-paper comparison**


Compare the following studies in terms of their theoretical assumptions, methods, and conclusions. Highlight points of convergence and divergence.

请从理论假设、研究方法和主要结论三个方面，对以下研究进行比较，并指出它们之间的一致之处与分歧。


**Pattern detection & synthesis**

Across these studies, identify recurring themes, contradictory findings, and shared methodological patterns.

在这些研究中，请识别反复出现的主题、相互矛盾的结论，以及共同的研究方法模式。


**Methodological reflection**

What methodological choices are most commonly adopted in this line of research, and what potential biases or limitations do they introduce?


在这一研究方向中，最常见的研究方法选择是什么？这些方法可能引入哪些偏差或局限？

**Positioning a study within the field**

How does this study position itself within the existing literature, and what gap does it explicitly or implicitly aim to address?

这项研究在现有文献中如何定位自身？它试图明确或隐含地填补哪些研究空白？

---


#### Field reflection

**Gap identification**

Based on this body of literature, what questions remain underexplored or systematically avoided?

基于这一系列文献，目前有哪些问题仍然缺乏系统研究，或被普遍回避？

**Broader Gap**

Assume you are a researcher familiar with **field X**. My review currently covers the following directions: A, B, and C.  
From the historical development of the field, what important perspectives, traditions, or lines of work might still be missing?

假设你是一位熟悉 **【领域 X】** 的研究者。我的综述目前已涵盖以下方向：A、B、C。  
从该领域的发展历史与研究脉络来看，可能还遗漏了哪些重要视角、研究传统或路线？


**Bridging to one’s own research**
Which aspects of this study are most directly relevant to my research, and which aspects are less transferable?

这项研究中，哪些方面与我的研究最直接相关？哪些部分的可迁移性较低？
