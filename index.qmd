## Note for the next work session

-   Prepare the intern task

The pitch can be checked in a few ways:

- pitch tracking figure (individual)
- pitch data (collective & interaction plotting)
- fpca results

I would filter out the files that needs to be checked, and then ask the intern to fix the 'x' label of these files. 

I would also write some simple code for them to explore the dataset. 

In addition, I would like to compare the inter-rater alignment regarding the common set. 

## To do for the week

-   AI literature review done

-   PCA interactive scripts

    -   Draft email sharing with Tong

    -   Draft email sharing with Michelle

-   Intern final meeting (with the final batch of work)

## Workflow for this site

Using github to keep track of key changes:

```         
git status # to check changes.
git add 
git commit -m ""
git push -u origin main
```

To check update:

```

```
