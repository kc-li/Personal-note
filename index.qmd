## Note for the next work session

-   Prepare the intern task

  - According to red files, move the files to a check folder (need to check in recording data recursively) [For interns to run prosodyPro to check x label]
  - For each intern, exclude the data in red & yellow.txt, generate a clean dataset for them
  - Write some simple exploration code
  - Write documentation

In addition, I would like to compare the inter-rater alignment regarding the common set. 

## To do for the week
