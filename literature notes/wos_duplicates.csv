The form and function processing of lexical tone and intonation in tone-language-speaking children with autism spectrum disorder,"Wang, L; Xiao, SR; Jiang, CM; Hou, QQ; Chan, AHD; Wong, PCM; Liu, F",2023,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Studies on how the form versus function aspect of tone and intonation is processed by autistic individuals have mainly focused on speakers of non-tonal languages (e.g., English) with equivocal results. While the samples' heterogeneous cognitive abilities may be contributing factors, the phenotype of tone and intonation processing in autism may also vary with one's language background. Thirty-eight cognitively able autistic and 32 non-autistic Mandarin-speaking children completed tone and intonation perception tasks, each containing a function and form condition. Results suggested that the abilities to discriminate tone and intonation were not impaired at either the form or function level in these autistic children, and that these abilities were positively associated with one another in both autistic and non-autistic groups. The more severe the autism symptoms, the worse the form- and function-level of tone and intonation processing. While enhanced tone and intonation processing has been found in a subgroup of autistic children, it may not be a general characteristic of the autistic population with long-term tone language experience. These findings reveal typical tone and intonation processing at both the form and function levels in cognitively able Mandarin-speaking autistic children and provide evidence for associated tone and intonation processing abilities across levels.",,,10.1121/10.0020271,WOS:001036228000003,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",the form and function processing of lexical tone and intonation in tone language speaking children with autism spectrum disorder,"Wang, L",doi:10.1121/10.0020271,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Intonation processing increases task-specific fronto-temporal connectivity in tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2021,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Language comprehension depends on tight functional interactions between distributed brain regions. While these interactions are established for semantic and syntactic processes, the functional network of speech intonation - the linguistic variation of pitch - has been scarcely defined. Particularly little is known about intonation in tonal languages, in which pitch not only serves intonation but also expresses meaning via lexical tones. The present study used psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterise the neural networks underlying intonation and tone processing in native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Participants categorised either intonation or tone of monosyllabic Mandarin words that gradually varied between statement and question and between Tone 2 and Tone 4. Intonation processing induced bilateral fronto-temporal activity and increased functional connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal regions, likely linking auditory perception and labelling of intonation categories in a phonological network. Tone processing induced bilateral temporal activity, associated with the auditory representation of tonal (phonemic) categories. Together, the present data demonstrate the breadth of the functional intonation network in a tonal language including higher-level phonological processes in addition to auditory representations common to both intonation and tone.",,,10.1002/hbm.25214,WOS:000573645300001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",intonation processing increases task specific fronto temporal connectivity in tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ",doi:10.1002/hbm.25214,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Mandarin-Speaking Amusics' Online Recognition of Tone and Intonation,"Tang, LR; Xu, YXX; Yang, ST; Meng, XY; Du, BQ; Sun, C; Liu, L; Dong, Q; Nan, Y",2024,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing. Its linguistic consequences have been examined separately for speech intonations and lexical tones. However, in a tonal language such as Chinese, the processing of intonations and lexical tones interacts with each other during online speech perception. Whether and how the musical pitch disorder might affect linguistic pitch processing during online speech perception remains unknown. Method: We investigated this question with intonation (question vs. statement) and lexical tone (rising Tone 2 vs. falling Tone 4) identification tasks using the same set of sentences, comparing behavioral and event -related potential measurements between Mandarin -speaking amusics and matched controls. We specifically focused on the amusics without behavioral lexical tone deficits (the majority, i.e., pure amusics). Results: Results showed that, despite relative to normal performance when tested in word lexical tone test, pure amusics demonstrated inferior recognition than controls during sentence tone and intonation identification. Compared to controls, pure amusics had larger N400 amplitudes in question stimuli during tone task and smaller P600 amplitudes in intonation task.

Online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin: Evidence from ERPs,"Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO",2016,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin at the attentive stage. We examined the behavioral and electrophysiological responses of native Mandarin listeners to Mandarin sentences, which contrast in final tones (rising Tone2 or falling Tone4) and intonations (Question or Statement). A clear P300 effect was observed for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone4, but no ERP effect was found for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone2. Our results provide ERP evidence for the interaction of tone and intonation in Mandarin, confirming the findings with behavioral metalinguistic data that native Mandarin listeners can distinguish between question intonation and statement intonation when the intonation is associated with a final Tone4, but fail to do so when the intonation is associated with a final Tone2. Our study extended the understanding of online processing of tone and intonation (1) from the pre-attentive stage to the attentive stage and (2) within a larger domain (i.e. multi-word utterances) than a single word utterance.

Context Matters for Tone and Intonation Processing in Mandarin,"Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO",2022,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"In tonal languages such as Mandarin, both lexical tone and sentence intonation are primarily signaled by F0. Their F0 encodings are sometimes in conflict and sometimes in congruency. The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that top-down information provided by the semantically constraining context can play a facilitating role for listeners to disentangle intonational information from tonal information, but mainly in sentences with the lexical falling tone in the final position.",,,10.1177/0023830920986174,WOS:000618452600001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",context matters for tone and intonation processing in mandarin,"Liu, M",doi:10.1177/0023830920986174,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
"Auditory Perception, Suprasegmental Speech Processing, and Vocabulary Development in Chinese Preschoolers","Wang, HLS; Chen, IC; Chiang, CH; Lai, YH; Tsao, Y",2016,PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS,"The current study examined the associations between basic auditory perception, speech prosodic processing, and vocabulary development in Chinese kindergartners, specifically, whether early basic auditory perception may be related to linguistic prosodic processing in Chinese Mandarin vocabulary acquisition. A series of language, auditory, and linguistic prosodic tests were given to 100 preschool children who had not yet learned how to read Chinese characters. The results suggested that lexical tone sensitivity and intonation production were significantly correlated with children's general vocabulary abilities. In particular, tone awareness was associated with comprehensive language development, whereas intonation production was associated with both comprehensive and expressive language development. Regression analyses revealed that tone sensitivity accounted for 36% of the unique variance in vocabulary development, whereas intonation production accounted for 6% of the variance in vocabulary development. Moreover, auditory frequency discrimination was significantly correlated with lexical tone sensitivity, syllable duration discrimination, and intonation production in Mandarin Chinese. Also it provided significant contributions to tone sensitivity and intonation production.

The Perception of Lexical Tone and Intonation in Whispered Speech by Mandarin-Speaking Congenital Amusics,"Zhang, GY; Shao, J; Zhang, CC; Wang, L",2022,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: A fundamental feature of human speech is variation, including the manner of phonation, as exemplified in the case of whispered speech. In this study, we employed whispered speech to examine an unresolved issue about congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical pitch processing, which also affects speech pitch processing such as lexical tone and intonation perception. The controversy concerns whether amusia is a pitch-processing disorder or can affect speech processing beyond pitch. Method: We examined lexical tone and intonation recognition in 19 Mandarin-speaking amusics and 19 matched controls in phonated and whispered speech, where fundamental frequency (f(o)) information is either present or absent. Results: The results revealed that the performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls in lexical tone identification in both phonated and whispered speech. These impairments were also detected in identifying intonation (statements/questions) in phonated and whispered modes. Across the experiments, regression models revealed that f(o) and non-f(o) (duration, intensity, and formant frequency) acoustic cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in phonated speech, whereas non-f(o) cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in whispered speech. There were significant differences between amusics and controls in the use of both f(o) and non-f(o) cues. Conclusion: The results provided the first evidence that the impairments of amusics in lexical tone and intonation identification prevail into whispered speech and support the hypothesis that the deficits of amusia extend beyond pitch processing.",,,10.1044/2021_jslhr-21-00345,WOS:000830953900007,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",the perception of lexical tone and intonation in whispered speech by mandarin speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, GY",doi:10.1044/2021_jslhr-21-00345,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non-tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2020,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Intonation, the modulation of pitch in speech, is a crucial aspect of language that is processed in right-hemispheric regions, beyond the classical left-hemispheric language system. Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.",,,10.1002/hbm.24916,WOS:000508026600001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ",doi:10.1002/hbm.24916,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
EARLY CORTICAL PROCESSING OF LINGUISTIC PITCH PATTERNS AS REVEALED BY THE MISMATCH NEGATIVITY,"Ren, GQ; Yang, Y; Li, X",2009,NEUROSCIENCE,"Previous brain imaging studies have shown the left hemispheric dominance for processing of lexical tone in native speakers. However, the low temporal resolution related to neuroimaging techniques might not explicitly detect the brain activities that occur at a relatively small or a determined time frame. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and a source estimation technique (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) to probe the brain activities underlying the early pre-attentive processing of Mandarin lexical tone and intonation. A passive oddball paradigm was applied to present tone and intonation contrast in a speech and nonspeech context. The results showed that no difference of the MMN amplitudes existed between speech and nonspeech conditions, although a larger MMN was found for tone than intonation condition. Source localization of the MMNs for all of the conditions showed the right hemispheric dominance, regardless of their linguistic functions (tone vs. intonation) or speech context (speech vs. nonspeech). Interestingly, the MMN generator for normal tone and hummed tone originated from the same cortical area (right parietal lobe, BA 19). These findings suggest that the pre-attentive cortical processing can be modulated not only by speech stimuli, but also by their nonspeech hums. Our data are compatible with the acoustic hypothesis of speech processing. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

"The interaction of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context in on-line spoken word recognition: An ERP study on Cantonese Chinese","Kung, C; Chwilla, DJ; Schriefers, H",2014,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"In two ERP experiments, we investigate the on-line interplay of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context during spoken word recognition in Cantonese Chinese. Experiment 1 shows that lexical tone and intonation interact immediately. Words with a low lexical tone at the end of questions (with a rising question intonation) lead to a processing conflict. This is reflected in a low accuracy in lexical identification and in a P600 effect compared to the same words at the end of a statement. Experiment 2 shows that a strongly biasing semantic context leads to much better lexical-identification performance for words with a low tone at the end of questions and to a disappearance of the P600 effect. These results support the claim that semantic context plays a major role in disentangling the tonal information from the intonational information, and thus, in resolving the on-line conflict between intonation and tone. However, the ERP data indicate that the introduction of a semantic context does not entirely eliminate on-line processing problems for words at the end of questions. This is revealed by the presence of an N400 effect for words with a low lexical tone and for words with a high-mid lexical tone at the end of questions. The ERP data thus show that, while semantic context helps in the eventual lexical identification, it makes the deviation of the contextually expected lexical tone from the actual acoustic signal more salient.

Modeling tone and intonation in Mandarin and English as a process of target approximation,"Prom-on, S; Xu, Y; Thipakorn, B",2009,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"This paper reports the development of a quantitative target approximation (qTA) model for generating F-0 contours of speech. The qTA model simulates the production of tone and intonation as a process of syllable-synchronized sequential target approximation [Xu, Y. (2005). ""Speech melody as articulatorily implemented communicative functions,"" Speech Commun. 46, 220-251]. It adopts a set of biomechanical and linguistic assumptions about the mechanisms of speech production. The communicative functions directly modeled are lexical tone in Mandarin and lexical stress in English and focus in both languages. The qTA model is evaluated by extracting function-specific model parameters from natural speech via supervised learning (automatic analysis by synthesis) and comparing the F-0 contours generated with the extracted parameters to those of natural utterances through numerical evaluation and perceptual testing. The F-0 contours generated by the qTA model with the learned parameters were very close to the natural contours in terms of root mean square error, rate of human identification of tone, and focus and judgment of naturalness by human listeners. The results demonstrate that the qTA model is both an effective tool for research on tone and intonation and a potentially effective system for automatic synthesis of tone and intonation.",,,10.1121/1.3037222,WOS:000262672600051,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",modeling tone and intonation in mandarin and english as a process of target approximation,"Prom-on, S",doi:10.1121/1.3037222,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2

We investigated whether this deficit extended to pitch processing in speech, notably the pitch changes used to contrast lexical tones in tonal languages. Congenital amusics and matched controls, all non-tonal language speakers, were tested for lexical tone discrimination in Mandarin Chinese (Experiment 1) and in Thai (Experiment 2). Tones were presented in pairs and participants were required to make same/different judgments. Experiment 2 additionally included musical analogs of Thai tones for comparison. Performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls for all materials, suggesting a domain-general pitch-processing deficit.

Normal pre-attentive and impaired attentive processing of lexical tones in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC; Shao, J",2018,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"The neural underpinnings of congenital amusia, an innate neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing, are not well understood. Previous studies suggest that amusia primarily impairs attentive processing (P300) of small pitch deviations in music, leaving pre-attentive pitch processing (mismatch negativity or MMN) more or less intact. However, it remains unknown whether the same neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficiency underlies pitch processing in speech, where amusics also often show impairment behaviorally. The current study examined how lexical tones are processed in pre-attentive (MMN) and attentive (P300) conditions in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 matched controls. At the pre-attentive level, Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited normal MMN responses to lexical tone changes, even for tone pairs with small pitch differences (mid level vs. low level tone; high rising vs. low rising tone). However, at the attentive level, amusics exhibited reduced P3a amplitude for all tone pairs, and further reduced P3b amplitude for tone pairs with small pitch differences. These results suggest that the amusic brain detects tone changes normally pre-attentively, but shows impairment in consciously detecting the same tone differences. Consistent with previous findings in nonspeech pitch processing, this finding provides support for a domain-general neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficient attentive pitch processing in amusia.",,,10.1038/s41598-018-26368-7,WOS:000433539800018,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",normal pre attentive and impaired attentive processing of lexical tones in cantonese speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC",doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26368-7,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Subgroup differences in the lexical tone mismatch negativity (MMN) among Mandarin speakers with congenital amusia,"Nan, Y; Huang, WT; Wang, WJ; Liu, C; Dong, Q",2016,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY,"The association/dissociation of pitch processing between music and language is a long lasting debate. We examined this music-language relationship by investigating to what extent pitch deficits in these two domains were dissociable. We focused on a special neurodevelopmental pitch disorder congenital amusia, which primarily affects musical pitch processing. Recent research has also revealed lexical tone deficits in speech among amusics. Approximately one-third of Mandarin amusics exhibits behavioural difficulties in lexical tone perception, which is known as tone agnosia. Using mismatch negativities (MMNs), our current work probed lexical tone encoding at the pre-attentive level among the Mandarin amusics with (tone agnosics) and without (pure amusics) behavioural lexical tone deficits compared with age- and IQ-matched controls. Relative to the controls and the pure amusics, the tone agnosics exhibited reduced MMNs specifically in response to lexical tone changes. Their tone-consonant MMNs were intact and similar to those of the other two groups. Moreover, the tone MMN reduction over the left hemisphere was tightly linked to behavioural insensitivity to lexical tone changes. The current study thus provides the first psychophysiological evidence of subgroup differences in lexical tone processing among Mandarin amusics and links amusics' behavioural tone deficits to impaired pre-attentive tone processing. Despite the overall music pitch deficits, the subgroup differences in lexical tone processing in Mandarin-speaking amusics suggest dissociation of pitch deficits between music and speech.

Universals of listening: Equivalent prosodic entrainment in tone and non-tone languages,"Ip, MHK; Cutler, A",2020,COGNITION,"In English and Dutch, listeners entrain to prosodic contours to predict where focus will fall in an utterance. Here, we ask whether this strategy is universally available, even in languages with very different phonological systems (e.g., tone versus non-tone languages). In a phoneme detection experiment, we examined whether prosodic entrainment also occurs in Mandarin Chinese, a tone language, where the use of various suprasegmental cues to lexical identity may take precedence over their use in salience. Consistent with the results from Germanic languages, response times were facilitated when preceding intonation predicted high stress on the target-bearing word, and the lexical tone of the target word (i.e., rising versus falling) did not affect the Mandarin listeners' response. Further, the extent to which prosodic entrainment was used to detect the target phoneme was the same in both English and Mandarin listeners. Nevertheless, native Mandarin speakers did not adopt an entrainment strategy when the sentences were presented in English, consistent with the suggestion that L2 listening may be strained by additional functional load from prosodic processing. These findings have implications for how universal and language-specific mechanisms interact in the perception of focus structure in everyday discourse.",,,10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311,WOS:000551338900012,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",universals of listening equivalent prosodic entrainment in tone and non tone languages,"Ip, MHK",doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Vowel and tone recognition in quiet and in noise among Mandarin-speaking amusics,"Tang, W; Wang, XJ; Li, JQ; Liu, C; Dong, Q; Nan, Y",2018,HEARING RESEARCH,"Music and language are two intricately linked communication modalities in humans. A deficit in music pitch processing as manifested in the condition of congenital amusia has been related to difficulties in lexical tone processing for both tone and non-tonal languages. However, it is still unclear whether amusia also affects the perception of vowel phonemes in quiet and in noise. In this study, we examined vowel-plustone identification in quiet and noise conditions among Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without speech tone difficulties (tone agnosics and pure amusics, respectively), and IQ- and age-matched controls. Overall, pure amusics showed vowel and tone identification comparable to the controls in both quiet and noise conditions. Compared to pure amusics and controls, tone agnosics showed deficits in tone perception in both quiet and noise conditions. More importantly, their vowel perception was lower than pure amusics and controls in noise conditions, e.g., at a signal-to-noise ratio of -4 dB, although they showed normal-like performance in quiet and at a signal-to-noise ratio of -8 dB. These results suggest that when amusia affected speech tone processing (e.g., tone agnosics), it could also compromise vowel processing in noise. However, amusia alone does not affect tone or vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese either in quiet or in noise. Overall, the current study highlights the necessity of taking heterogeneity within the amusic group into account when considering the related speech deficits in this group. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

From melody to lexical tone: Musical ability enhances specific aspects of foreign language perception,"Delogu, F; Lampis, G; Belardinelli, MO",2010,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,"Previous research shows that music ability provides positive effects on language processing. This study aims at better clarifying the involvement of different linguistic subdomains in this cross-domain link, assessing whether or not musicality and music expertise enhance phonological and lexical tone processing of Mandarin Chinese.

Main results show that all subjects perform significantly better in detecting phonological variations rather than tonal ones. They also show that both melodic proficiency and music expertise are good predictors for a better tonal, but not phonological identification. Data lead to a model of music-to-language transfer effect in which musicality selectively affects linguistic intonation while leaving phonological processing substantially unaffected.",,,10.1080/09541440802708136,WOS:000274915800004,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",from melody to lexical tone musical ability enhances specific aspects of foreign language perception,"Delogu, F",doi:10.1080/09541440802708136,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Linguistic Tone and Non-Linguistic Pitch Imitation in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Cross-Linguistic Investigation,"Chen, F; Cheung, CCH; Peng, G",2022,JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS,"The conclusions on prosodic pitch features in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have primarily been derived from studies in non-tonal language speakers. This cross-linguistic study evaluated the performance of imitating Cantonese lexical tones and their non-linguistic (nonspeech) counterparts by Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD. Acoustic analyses showed that, compared with typically developing peers, children with ASD exhibited increased pitch variations when imitating lexical tones, while performed similarly when imitating the nonspeech counterparts. Furthermore, Mandarin-speaking children with ASD failed to exploit the phonological knowledge of segments to improve the imitation accuracy of non-native lexical tones. These findings help clarify the speech-specific pitch processing atypicality and phonological processing deficit in tone-language-speaking children with ASD.",,,10.1007/s10803-021-05123-4,WOS:000659415100004,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",linguistic tone and non linguistic pitch imitation in children with autism spectrum disorders a cross linguistic investigation,"Chen, F",doi:10.1007/s10803-021-05123-4,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
How experience with tone in the native language affects the L2 acquisition of pitch accents,"Zahner-Ritter, K; Zhao, TY; Einfeldt, M; Braun, B",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This paper tested the ability of Mandarin learners of German, whose native language has lexical tone, to imitate pitch accent contrasts in German, an intonation language. In intonation languages, pitch accents do not convey lexical information; also, pitch accents are sparser than lexical tones as they only associate with prominent words in the utterance. We compared two kinds of German pitch-accent contrasts: (1) a ""non-merger"" contrast, which Mandarin listeners perceive as different and (2) a ""merger"" contrast, which sounds more similar to Mandarin listeners. Speakers of a tone language are generally very sensitive to pitch. Hypothesis 1 (H1) therefore stated that Mandarin learners produce the two kinds of contrasts similarly to native German speakers. However, the documented sensitivity to tonal contrasts, at the expense of processing phrase-level intonational contrasts, may generally hinder target-like production of intonational pitch accents in the L2 (Hypothesis 2, H2). Finally, cross-linguistic influence (CLI) predicts a difference in the realization of these two contrasts as well as improvement with higher proficiency (Hypothesis 3, H3). We used a delayed imitation paradigm, which is well-suited for assessing L2-phonetics and -phonology because it does not necessitate access to intonational meaning. We investigated the imitation of three kinds of accents, which were associated with the sentence-final noun in short wh-questions (e.g., Wer malt denn Mandalas, lit: ""Who draws PRT mandalas?"" ""Who likes drawing mandalas?""). In Experiment 1, 28 native speakers of Mandarin participated (14 low- and 14 high-proficient). The learners' productions of the two kinds of contrasts were analyzed using General Additive Mixed Models to evaluate differences in pitch accent contrasts over time, in comparison to the productions of native German participants from an earlier study in our lab. Results showed a more pronounced realization of the non-merger contrast compared to German natives and a less distinct realization of the merger contrast, with beneficial effects of proficiency, lending support to H3. Experiment 2 tested low-proficient Italian learners of German (whose L1 is an intonation language) to contextualize the Mandarin data and further investigate CLI. Italian learners realized the non-merger contrast more target-like than Mandarin learners, lending additional support to CLI (H3).",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879,WOS:000861273800001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",how experience with tone in the native language affects the l2 acquisition of pitch accents,"Zahner-Ritter, K",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Deficits of congenital amusia beyond pitch: Evidence from impaired categorical perception of vowels in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Huang, XN",2017,PLOS ONE,"Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder of fine-grained pitch processing in music and speech. However, it remains unclear whether amusia is a pitch-specific deficit, or whether it affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly, such as the perception of formant frequency in vowels, apart from pitch. In this study, in order to illuminate the scope of the deficits, we compared the performance of 15 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 15 matched controls on the categorical perception of sound continua in four stimulus contexts: lexical tone, pure tone, vowel, and voice onset time (VOT). Whereas lexical tone, pure tone and vowel continua rely on frequency/spectral processing, the VOT continuum depends on duration/temporal processing. We found that the amusic participants performed similarly to controls in all stimulus contexts in the identification, in terms of the across-category boundary location and boundary width. However, the amusic participants performed systematically worse than controls in discriminating stimuli in those three contexts that depended on frequency/spectral processing (lexical tone, pure tone and vowel), whereas they performed normally when discriminating duration differences (VOT). These findings suggest that the deficit of amusia is probably not pitch specific, but affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly. Furthermore, there appeared to be differences in the impairment of frequency/spectral discrimination in speech and nonspeech contexts. The amusic participants exhibited less benefit in between-category discriminations than controls in speech contexts (lexical tone and vowel), suggesting reduced categorical perception; on the other hand, they performed inferiorly compared to controls across the board regardless of between-and within-category discriminations in nonspeech contexts (pure tone), suggesting impaired general auditory processing. These differences imply that the frequency/spectral-processing deficit might be manifested differentially in speech and nonspeech contexts in amusics D it is manifested as a deficit of higher-level phonological processing in speech sounds, and as a deficit of lower-level auditory processing in nonspeech sounds.",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0183151,WOS:000408085100029,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",deficits of congenital amusia beyond pitch evidence from impaired categorical perception of vowels in cantonese speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC",doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0183151,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Vowel and Tone Identification for Mandarin Congenital Amusics: Effects of Vowel Type and Semantic Content,"Li, MS; Tang, W; Liu, C; Nan, Y; Wang, WJ; Dong, Q",2019,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the effects of Mandarin congenital amusia with or without lexical tone deficit (i.e., tone agnosia and pure amusia) on Mandarin vowel and tone identification in different types of vowels (e.g., monophthong, diphthongs, and triphthongs) embedded in consonant-vowel contexts with and without semantic content. Method: Thirteen pure amusics (i.e., amusics with normal lexical processing), 5 tone agnosics (i.e., with lexical tone deficit), and 12 controls were screened with Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia and lexical tone tests (Nan et al., 2010; Peretz et al., 2003). Vowel-plus-tone identification tasks with the factors of vowel type and syllables with and without semantic content (e.g., real and nonsense words) were examined among the 3 groups, and identification scores were calculated in 3 formats: vowel-plus-tone identification, vowel identification, and tone identification. Results: Tone agnosics showed significantly poorer performances on identifications of vowel, tone, and vowel plus tone across monophthongs, diphthongs, and triphthongs in both real and nonsense words compared to pure amusics and controls. Their deficits were similar across the 3 types of vowels, while the deficit on vowel-plus-tone identification was more severe in nonsense words than in real words. On the other hand, pure amusics performed similarly with controls across all these conditions. Conclusions: Tone agnosia might affect both musical pitch and phonological processing, resulting in deficits in lexical tone and vowel perception. On the contrary, pure amusics's effect is primarily on musical pitch perception but not on lexical tone or phonemic deficit. Vowel type did not affect speech deficits for tone agnosics, while they relied more on semantic content as a compensation.",,,10.1044/2019_jslhr-s-18-0440,WOS:000561769300006,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",vowel and tone identification for mandarin congenital amusics effects of vowel type and semantic content,"Li, MS",doi:10.1044/2019_jslhr-s-18-0440,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Processing of Acoustic Cues in Lexical-Tone Identification by Pediatric Cochlear-Implant Recipients,"Peng, SC; Lu, HP; Lu, N; Lin, YS; Deroche, MLD; Chatterjee, M",2017,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: The objective was to investigate acoustic cue processing in lexical-tone recognition by pediatric cochlear-implant (CI) recipients who are native Mandarin speakers. Method: Lexical-tone recognition was assessed in pediatric CI recipients and listeners with normal hearing (NH) in 2 tasks. In Task 1, participants identified naturally uttered words that were contrastive in lexical tones. For Task 2, a disyllabic word (yanjing) was manipulated orthogonally, varying in fundamental-frequency (F0) contours and duration patterns. Participants identified each token with the second syllable jing pronounced with Tone 1 (a high level tone) as eyes or with Tone 4 (a high falling tone) as eyeglasses. Results: CI participants' recognition accuracy was significantly lower than NH listeners' in Task 1. In Task 2, CI participants' reliance on F0 contours was significantly less than that of NH listeners; their reliance on duration patterns, however, was significantly higher than that of NH listeners. Both CI and NH listeners' performance in Task 1 was significantly correlated with their reliance on F0 contours in Task 2.

It has been shown that native speakers of French, a language without lexical stress, have difficulties storing non-native stress contrasts. We investigated whether the ability to store lexical tone (as in Mandarin Chinese) also depends on the first language (L I) prosodic structure and, if so, how. We tested participants from a stress language (German), a language without word stress (French), a language with restricted lexical tonal contrasts (Japanese), and Mandarin Chinese controls. Furthermore, German has a rich intonational structure, while French and Japanese dispose of fewer utterance-level pitch contrasts. The participants learnt associations between disyllabic non-words (4 tonal contrasts) and objects and indicated whether picture word pairs matched with what they had learnt (complete match, segmental or tonal mismatch conditions). In the tonal mismatch condition, the Mandarin Chinese controls had the highest sensitivity, followed by the German participants.

Question or tone 2? How language experience and linguistic function guide pitch processing,"Braun, B; Johnson, EK",2011,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"How does language experience shape pitch processing? Do speakers of tone languages, which use pitch to signal lexical contrasts (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) attend to pitch movements more closely than speakers of intonation languages (e.g., Dutch)? Contradictory findings have been reported in the literature. In the current study, we hypothesize that listeners should be particularly attentive to any pitch information that signals meaningful information in the native language. This includes pitch movements signaling lexical contrasts (present in tone languages only) as well as postlexical contrasts (present in all languages). Both Mandarin and Dutch listeners performed speeded ABX match to sample tasks on the same sets of nonsense words. As predicted, the same pitch movements were attended to differentially by the two language populations depending on the role that information played in the native language. Mandarin listeners were more attentive than Dutch listeners to pitch movements as these signaled potential lexical contrasts in Mandarin (but not Dutch). Importantly, Dutch listeners were more attentive to pitch movements signaling postlexical information than to pitch movements signaling no meaningful linguistic information. These findings underscore the importance of postlexical information in online speech processing and explain apparent contradictions in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that both the amusics and tone agnosics underperformed the controls on musical pitch production. However, tone agnosics performed no worse than the amusics, suggesting that lexical tone perception deficits may not aggravate musical pitch production difficulties. Moreover, these three groups were all able to imitate lexical tones with perfect intelligibility. Taken together, the current study shows that perceptual musical pitch and lexical tone deficits might coexist with musical pitch production difficulties. But at the same time these perceptual pitch deficits might not affect lexical tone production or the intelligibility of the speech words that were produced.

Pitch perception and production in congenital amusia: Evidence from Cantonese speakers,"Liu, F; Chan, AHD; Ciocca, V; Roquet, C; Peretz, I; Wong, PCM",2016,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"This study investigated pitch perception and production in speech and music in individuals with congenital amusia (a disorder of musical pitch processing) who are native speakers of Cantonese, a tone language with a highly complex tonal system. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics and 16 controls performed a set of lexical tone perception, production, singing, and psychophysical pitch threshold tasks. Their tone production accuracy and singing proficiency were subsequently judged by independent listeners, and subjected to acoustic analyses. Relative to controls, amusics showed impaired discrimination of lexical tones in both speech and non-speech conditions. They also received lower ratings for singing proficiency, producing larger pitch interval deviations and making more pitch interval errors compared to controls. Demonstrating higher pitch direction identification thresholds than controls for both speech syllables and piano tones, amusics nevertheless produced native lexical tones with comparable pitch trajectories and intelligibility as controls. Significant correlations were found between pitch threshold and lexical tone perception, music perception and production, but not between lexical tone perception and production for amusics. These findings provide further evidence that congenital amusia is a domain-general language-independent pitch-processing deficit that is associated with severely impaired music perception and production, mildly impaired speech perception, and largely intact speech production.

Brainstem encoding of speech and musical stimuli in congenital amusia: evidence from Cantonese speakers,"Liu, F; Maggu, AR; Lau, JCY; Wong, PCM",2015,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,"Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical processing that also impacts subtle aspects of speech processing.

In this study, we investigated whether amusia originates from impaired subcortical encoding of speech On quiet and noise) and musical sounds in the brainstem. Fourteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 14 matched controls passively listened to six Cantonese lexical tones in quiet, two Cantonese tones in noise (signal-to-noise ratios at 0 and 20 dB), and two cello tones in quiet while their frequency-following responses (FFRs) to these tones were recorded. All participants also completed a behavioral lexical tone identification task. The results indicated normal brainstem encoding of pitch in speech On quiet and noise) and musical stimuli in amusics relative to controls, as measured by FFR pitch strength, pitch error, and stimulus-to-response correlation. There was also no group difference in neural conduction time or FFR amplitudes. Both groups demonstrated better FFRs to speech On quiet and noise) than to musical stimuli. However, a significant group difference was observed for tone identification, with amusics showing significantly lower accuracy than controls. Analysis of the tone confusion matrices suggested that amusics were more likely than controls to confuse between tones that shared similar acoustic features. Interestingly, this deficit in lexical tone identification was not coupled with brainstem abnormality for either speech or musical stimuli. Together, our results suggest that the amusic brainstem is not functioning abnormally, although higher-order linguistic pitch processing is impaired in amusia.

Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese,"Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,WOS:000813299300001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",perception of different tone contrasts at sub lexical and lexical levels by dutch learners of mandarin chinese,"Zou, T",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Processing of Acoustic Information in Lexical Tone Production and Perception by Pediatric Cochlear Implant Recipients,"Deroche, MLD; Lu, HP; Lin, YS; Chatterjee, M; Peng, SC",2019,FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE,"Purpose: This study examined the utilization of multiple types of acoustic information in lexical tone production and perception by pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients who are native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Methods: Lexical tones were recorded from CI recipients and their peers with normal hearing (NH). Each participant was asked to produce a disyllabic word, yan jing, with which the first syllable was pronounced as Tone 3 (a low dipping tone) while the second syllable was pronounced as Tone 1 (a high level tone, meaning ""eyes"") or as Tone 4 (a high falling tone, meaning ""eyeglasses""). In addition, a parametric manipulation in fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of Tones 1 and 4 used in a lexical tone recognition task in Peng et al. (2017) was adopted to evaluate the perceptual reliance on each dimension. Results: Mixed-effect analyses of duration, intensity, and F0 cues revealed that NH children focused exclusively on marking distinct F0 contours, while CI participants shortened Tone 4 or prolonged Tone 1 to enhance their contrast. In line with these production strategies, NH children relied primarily on F0 cues to identify the two tones, whereas CI children showed greater reliance on duration cues. Moreover, CI participants who placed greater perceptual weight on duration cues also tended to exhibit smaller changes in their F0 production.

No Musician Advantage in the Perception of Degraded-Fundamental Frequency Speech in Noisy Environments,"Hsieh, IH; Guo, YJ",2023,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: Pitch variations of the fundamental frequency (fo) contour contribute to speech perception in noisy environments, but whether musicians confer an advantage in speech in noise (SIN) with altered fo information remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different levels of degraded fo contour (i.e., conveying lexical tone or intonation information) on musician advantage in speech-in-noise perception.Method: A cohort of native Mandarin Chinese speakers, comprising 30 trained musicians and 30 nonmusicians, were tested on the intelligibility of Mandarin Chinese sentences with natural, flattened-tone, flattened-intonation, and flattened-all fo contours embedded in background noise masked under three signal-to-noise ratios (0, -5, and -9 dB). Pitch difference thresholds and innate musical skills associated with speech-in-noise benefits were also assessed.Results: Speech intelligibility score improved with increasing signal-to-noise level for both musicians and nonmusicians. However, no musician advantage was observed for identifying any type of flattened-fo contour SIN. Musicians exhibited smaller fo pitch discrimination limens than nonmusicians, which correlated with benefits for perceiving speech with intact tone-level fo information. Regardless of musician status, performance on the pitch and accent musical skill subtests correlated with speech intelligibility score. Conclusions: Collectively, these results provide no evidence for a musician advantage for perceiving speech with distorted fo information in noisy environments. Results further show that perceptual musical skills on pitch and accent processing may benefit the perception of SIN, independent of formal musical training. Our findings suggest that the potential application of music training in speech perception in noisy backgrounds is not contingent on the ability to process fo pitch contours, at least for Mandarin Chinese speakers.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23706354",,,10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00662,WOS:001056733600006,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",no musician advantage in the perception of degraded fundamental frequency speech in noisy environments,"Hsieh, IH",doi:10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00662,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Research Article Tone Deafness in Music Does Not Preclude Distributional Learning of Nonnative Tonal Languages in Individuals With Congenital Amusia,"Zhu, JQ; Chen, XX; Chen, F; Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Wiener, S",2023,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: Previous studies have shown that individuals with congenital amusia exhibit deficient pitch processing across music and language domains. This study investigated whether adult Chinese-speaking listeners with amusia were still able to learn Thai lexical tones based on stimulus frequency of statistical distribution via distributional learning, despite their degraded lexical tone perception. Method: Following a pretest-training-posttest design, 21 amusics and 23 typical, musically intact listeners were assigned into bimodal and unimodal distribution conditions. Listeners were asked to discriminate minimal pairs of Thai midlevel tone and falling tone superimposed on variable base syllables and uttered by different speakers. The perceptual accuracy for each test session and improvement from pretest to posttest were collected and analyzed between the two groups using generalized mixed-effects models. Results: When discriminating Thai lexical tones, amusics were less accurate than typical listeners. Nonetheless, similarly to control listeners, perceptual gains from pretest to posttest were observed in bimodally rather than unimodally trained amusics, as evidenced by both trained and nontrained test words. Conclusions: Amusics are able to learn lexical tones in a second or foreign context of speech. This extends previous research by showing that amusics' distributional learning of linguistic pitch remains largely preserved despite their degraded pitch processing. It is thus likely that manifestations of amusia in speech could not result from their abnormal statistical learning mechanism. This study meanwhile provides a heuristic approach for future studies to apply this paradigm into amusics' treatment to mitigate their pitch-processing disorder.",,,10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00572,WOS:001041295400018,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",research article tone deafness in music does not preclude distributional learning of nonnative tonal languages in individuals with congenital amusia,"Zhu, JQ",doi:10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00572,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
The Influence of Tonal and Atonal Bilingualism on Children's Lexical and Non-Lexical Tone Perception,"Morett, LM",2020,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"This study examined how bilingualism in an atonal language, in addition to a tonal language, influences lexical and non-lexical tone perception and word learning during childhood. Forty children aged 5;3-7;2, bilingual either in English and Mandarin or English and another atonal language, were tested on Mandarin lexical tone discrimination, level-pitch sine-wave tone discrimination, and learning of novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone. Mandarin-English bilingual children discriminated between and learned novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone more accurately than their atonal-English bilingual peers. However, Mandarin-English and atonal-English bilingual children discriminated between level-pitch sine-wave tones with similar accuracy. Moreover, atonal-English bilingual children showed a tendency to perceive differing Mandarin lexical and level-pitch sine-wave tones as identical, whereas their Mandarin-English peers showed no such tendency. These results indicate that bilingualism in a tonal language in addition to an atonal language-but not bilingualism in two atonal languages-allows for continued sensitivity to lexical tone beyond infancy. Moreover, they suggest that although tonal-atonal bilingualism does not enhance sensitivity to differences in pitch between sine-wave tones beyond infancy any more effectively than atonal-atonal bilingualism, it protects against the development of biases to perceive differing lexical and non-lexical tones as identical. Together, the results indicate that, beyond infancy, tonal-atonal bilinguals process lexical tones using different cognitive mechanisms than atonal-atonal bilinguals, but that both groups process level-pitch non-lexical tone using the same cognitive mechanisms.",,,10.1177/0023830919834679,WOS:000537760600002,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",the influence of tonal and atonal bilingualism on children s lexical and non lexical tone perception,"Morett, LM",doi:10.1177/0023830919834679,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Effects of production training and perception training on lexical tone perception - A behavioral and ERP study,"Lu, S; Wayland, R; Kaan, E",2015,BRAIN RESEARCH,"The present study recorded both behavioral data and event-related brain potentials to examine the effectiveness of a perception-only training and a perception-plus-production training procedure on the intentional and unintentional perception of lexical tone by native English listeners. In the behavioral task, both the perception-only and the perception-plus-production groups improved on the tone discrimination abilities after the training session. Moreover, the participants in both groups generalized the improvements gained through the trained stimuli to the untrained stimuli. In the ERP task, the Mismatch Negativity was smaller in the post-training task than in the pre-training task. However, the two training groups did not differ in tone processing at the intentional or unintentional level after training. These results suggest that the employment of the motor system does not specifically benefit the tone perceptual skills. Furthermore, the present study investigated whether some tone pairs are more easily confused than others by native English listeners, and whether the order of tone presentation influences non-native tone discrimination. In the behavioral task, Tone2-Tone1 (rising-level) and Tone2-Tone4 (rising-falling) were the most difficult tone pairs, while Tone1-Tone2 and Tone4-Tone2 were the easiest tone pairs, even though they involved the same tone contrasts respectively. In the ERP task, the native English listeners had good discrimination when Tone2 and Tone4 were embedded in strings of Tone1, while poor discrimination when Tone1 was inserted in the context of Tone2 or Tone4. These asymmetries in tone perception might be attributed to the interference of native intonation system and can be altered by training. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Auditory-Motor Mapping Training Facilitates Speech and Word Learning in Tone Language-Speaking Children With Autism: An Early Efficacy Study,"Yan, JT; Chen, F; Gao, XT; Peng, G",2021,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: It has been reported that tone language-speaking children with autism demonstrate speech-specific lexical tone processing difficulty, although they have intact or even better-than-normal processing of nonspeech/melodic pitch analogues. In this early efficacy study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) in facilitating speech and word output for Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism, in comparison with a matched non-AMMT-based control treatment. Method: Fifteen Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism spectrum disorder participated and completed all the AMMT-based treatment sessions by intoning (singing) and tapping the target words delivered via an app, whereas another 15 participants received control treatment. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to evaluate speech production accuracy and word production intelligibility across different groups and conditions. Results: Results showed that the AMMT-based treatment provided a more effective training approach in accelerating the rate of speech (especially lexical tone) and word learning in the trained items. More importantly, the enhanced training efficacy on lexical tone acquisition remained at 2 weeks after therapy and generalized to untrained tones that were not practiced. Furthermore, the low-verbal participants showed higher improvement compared to the nonverbal participants. Conclusions: These data provide the first empirical evidence for adopting the AMMT-based training to facilitate speech and word learning in Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism. This early efficacy study holds promise for improving lexical tone production in Mandarin-speaking children with autism but should be further replicated in larger scale randomized studies.

Talker normalization in typical Cantonese-speaking listeners and congenital amusics: Evidence from event-related potentials,"Shao, J; Zhang, CC",2019,NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL,"Despite the lack of invariance in the mapping between the acoustic signal and phonological representation, typical listeners are capable of using information of a talker's vocal characteristics to recognize phonemes, a process known as ""talker normalization"". The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100-150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the ""active control theory"". On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual ""anchoring"" deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.",,,10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814,WOS:000485804400006,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",talker normalization in typical cantonese speaking listeners and congenital amusics evidence from event related potentials,"Shao, J",doi:10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
The affective iconicity of lexical tone: Evidence from standard Chinesea),"Zheng, TT; Levelt, CC; Chen, YY",2025,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Previous studies suggested that pitch characteristics of lexical tones in Standard Chinese influence various sensory perceptions, but whether they iconically bias emotional experience remained unclear. We analyzed the arousal and valence ratings of bi-syllabic words in two corpora (Study 1) and conducted an affect rating experiment using a carefully designed corpus of bi-syllabic words (Study 2). Two-alternative forced-choice tasks further tested the robustness of lexical tones' affective iconicity in an auditory nonce word context (Study 3). Hierarchical linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and cross-validation were employed to understand the relationship between lexical tones and the emotional responses of tone-carrying words. Results consistently indicated that words with a falling-falling tonal sequence, both real and nonce words, received higher arousal ratings than those with rising-rising and rising-low tones. Only in nonce words, the high-high sequence was more likely to be associated with the low-arousal option; the falling-falling tone sequence was more often linked to negative-valence choice, while high-high and rising-rising tones with positive-valence. These findings, though subtle, suggest that the use of pitch in lexical tones influences emotional responses during the processing of tone-carrying words, pointing to an inherent iconic quality in lexical tones that may subtly shape speakers' emotional experiences.",,,10.1121/10.0034863,WOS:001405930900002,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",the affective iconicity of lexical tone evidence from standard chinesea,"Zheng, TT",doi:10.1121/10.0034863,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Melodic Pitch Perception and Lexical Tone Perception in Mandarin-Speaking Cochlear Implant Users,"Tao, DD; Deng, R; Jiang, Y; Galvin, JJ; Fu, QJ; Chen, B",2015,EAR AND HEARING,"Objectives: To examine the relationship between lexical tone perception and melodic pitch perception in Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant (CI) users and to investigate the influence of previous acoustic hearing on CI users' speech and music perception. Design: Lexical tone perception and melodic contour identification (MCI) were measured in 21 prelingual and 11 postlingual young (aged 6-26 years) Mandarin-speaking CI users. Lexical tone recognition was measured for four tonal patterns: tone 1 (flat F0), tone 2 (rising F0), tone 3 (falling-rising F0), and tone 4 (falling F0). MCI was measured using nine five-note melodic patterns that contained changes in pitch contour, as well as different semitone spacing between notes. Results: Lexical tone recognition was generally good (overall mean = 81% correct), and there was no significant difference between subject groups. MCI performance was generally poor (mean = 23% correct). MCI performance was significantly better for postlingual (mean = 32% correct) than for prelingual CI participants (mean = 18% correct). After correcting for outliers, there was no significant correlation between lexical tone recognition and MCI performance for prelingual or postlingual CI participants. Age at deafness was significantly correlated with MCI performance only for postlingual participants. CI experience was significantly correlated with MCI performance for both prelingual and postlingual participants. Duration of deafness was significantly correlated with tone recognition only for prelingual participants. Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of pitch cues in Mandarin, the present CI participants had great difficulty perceiving melodic pitch. The availability of amplitude and duration cues in lexical tones most likely compensated for the poor pitch perception observed with these CI listeners. Previous acoustic hearing experience seemed to benefit postlingual CI users' melodic pitch perception. Longer CI experience was associated with better MCI performance for both subject groups, suggesting that CI users' music perception may improve as they gain experience with their device.",,,10.1097/aud.0000000000000086,WOS:000346911200011,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",melodic pitch perception and lexical tone perception in mandarin speaking cochlear implant users,"Tao, DD",doi:10.1097/aud.0000000000000086,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Post-low bouncing in Mandarin Chinese: Acoustic analysis and computational modeling,"Prom-on, S; Liu, F; Xu, Y",2012,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Post-low bouncing is a phenomenon whereby after reaching a very low pitch in a low lexical tone, F-0 bounces up and then gradually drops back in the following syllables. This paper reports the results of an acoustic analysis of the phenomenon in two Mandarin Chinese corpora and presents a simple mechanical model that can effectively simulate this bouncing effect. The acoustic analysis shows that most of the F-0 dynamic features profiling the bouncing effect strongly correlate with the amount of F-0 lowering in the preceding low-tone syllable, and that the additional F-0 raising commences at the onset of the first post-low syllable. Using the quantitative Target Approximation model, this bouncing effect was simulated by adding an acceleration adjustment to the initial F-0 state of the first post-low syllable. A highly linear relation between F-0 lowering and estimated acceleration adjustment was found. This relation was then used to effectively simulate the bouncing effect in both the neutral tone and the full tones. The results of the analysis and simulation are consistent with the hypothesis that the bouncing effect is due to a temporary perturbation of the balance between antagonistic forces in the laryngeal control in producing a very low pitch.

Reduced Context Effect on Lexical Tone Normalization in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Speech-Specific Mechanism,"Kuang, C; Chen, F; Yan, JT; Peng, G",2025,JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS,"Existing literature has demonstrated that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical use of contextual information in their surroundings. However, there is limited understanding regarding their integration of contextual cues in speech processing. This study aims to explore how Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD identify lexical tones in speech and nonspeech contexts, and to determine whether the size of context effect would be modulated by children's cognitive abilities. Twenty-five children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) children were asked to identify Mandarin lexical tones preceded by three types of contexts (speech, nonspeech, and nonspeech-flattened contexts). We also tested child participants' verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory capacity. Results revealed that the context effect was only observed in the speech contexts, where Mandarin-speaking children with ASD exhibited a reduced context effect compared to TD children. Moreover, TD children with higher verbal intelligence demonstrated a diminished context effect. However, nonverbal intelligence and working memory capacity were not significantly associated with the size of context effect in either group. These findings revealed a subtle yet important difference between ASD and TD children's utilization of speech contexts in lexical tone identification, and validated a speech-specific mechanism underpinning children's lexical tone normalization.",,,10.1007/s10803-025-06775-2,WOS:001438996300001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",reduced context effect on lexical tone normalization in children with autism spectrum disorder a speech specific mechanism,"Kuang, C",doi:10.1007/s10803-025-06775-2,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Just-Noticeable Differences of Fundamental Frequency Change in Mandarin-Speaking Children with Cochlear Implants,"Huang, WT; Wong, LLN; Chen, F",2022,BRAIN SCIENCES,"Fundamental frequency (F0) provides the primary acoustic cue for lexical tone perception in tonal languages but remains poorly represented in cochlear implant (CI) systems.

In the present study, just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of F0 contour and F0 level changes in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs were measured and compared with those in their age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Results showed that children with CIs demonstrated significantly larger JND of F0 contour (JND-C) change and F0 level (JND-L) change compared to NH children. Further within-group comparison revealed that the JND-C change was significantly smaller than the JND-L change among children with CIs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among NH children. No significant correlations were seen between JND-C change/JND-L change and age at implantation /duration of CI use.

Chinese-English Speakers' Perception of Pitch in Their Non-Tonal Language: Reinterpreting English as a Tonal-Like Language,"Ortega-Llebaria, M; Wu, ZH",2021,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"Changing the F0-contour of English words does not change their lexical meaning. However, it changes the meaning in tonal languages such as Mandarin. Given this important difference and knowing that words in the two languages of a bilingual lexicon interact, the question arises as to how Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in their bilingual lexicon. The few studies that addressed this question showed that Mandarin-English speakers did not perceive pitch in English words as native English speakers did. These studies, however, used English words as stimuli failing to examine nonwords and Mandarin words. Consequently, possible pre-lexical effects and L1 transfer were not ruled out. The present study fills this gap by examining pitch perception in Mandarin and English words and nonwords by Mandarin-English speakers and a group of native English controls. Results showed the tonal experience of Chinese-English speakers modulated their perception of pitch in their non-tonal language at both pre-lexical and lexical levels. In comparison to native English controls, tonal speakers were more sensitive to the acoustic salience of F0-contours in the pre-lexical processing due to top-down feedback. At the lexical level, Mandarin-English speakers organized words in their two languages according to similarity criteria based on both F0 and segmental information, whereas only the segmental information was relevant to the control group. These results in perception together with consistently reported production patterns in previous literature suggest that Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in English as if it was a one-tone language.",,,10.1177/0023830919894606,WOS:000507060400001,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"")",chinese english speakers perception of pitch in their non tonal language reinterpreting english as a tonal like language,"Ortega-Llebaria, M",doi:10.1177/0023830919894606,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Intonation processing increases task-specific fronto-temporal connectivity in tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2021,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Language comprehension depends on tight functional interactions between distributed brain regions. While these interactions are established for semantic and syntactic processes, the functional network of speech intonation - the linguistic variation of pitch - has been scarcely defined. Particularly little is known about intonation in tonal languages, in which pitch not only serves intonation but also expresses meaning via lexical tones. The present study used psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterise the neural networks underlying intonation and tone processing in native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Participants categorised either intonation or tone of monosyllabic Mandarin words that gradually varied between statement and question and between Tone 2 and Tone 4. Intonation processing induced bilateral fronto-temporal activity and increased functional connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal regions, likely linking auditory perception and labelling of intonation categories in a phonological network. Tone processing induced bilateral temporal activity, associated with the auditory representation of tonal (phonemic) categories.

Hemispheric roles in the perception of speech prosody,"Gandour, J; Tong, YX; Wong, D; Talavage, T; Dzemidzic, M; Xu, YS; Li, XJ; Lowe, M",2004,NEUROIMAGE,"Speech prosody is processed in neither a single region nor a specific hemisphere, but engages multiple areas comprising a large-scale spatially distributed network in both hemispheres. It remains to be elucidated whether hemispheric lateralization is based on higher-level prosodic representations or lower-level encoding of acoustic cues, or both. A cross-language (Chinese; English) fMRI study was conducted to examine brain activity elicited by selective attention to Chinese intonation (I) and tone (T) presented in three-syllable (I3, T3) and one-syllable (I1, T1) utterance pairs in a speeded response, discrimination paradigm. The Chinese group exhibited greater activity than the English in a left inferior parietal region across tasks (I1, I3, T1, T3). Only the Chinese group exhibited a leftward asymmetry in inferior parietal and posterior superior temporal (I1, I3, T1, T3), anterior temporal (I1, I3, T1, T3), and frontopolar (I1, I3) regions. Both language groups shared a rightward asymmetry in the mid portions of the superior temporal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus irrespective of prosodic unit or temporal interval. Hemispheric laterality effects enable us to distinguish brain activity associated with higher-order prosodic representations in the Chinese group from that associated with lower-level acoustic/auditory processes that are shared among listeners regardless of language experience. Lateralization is influenced by language experience that shapes the internal prosodic representation of an external auditory signal. We propose that speech prosody perception is mediated primarily by the RH, but is left-lateralized to task-dependent regions when language processing is required beyond the auditory analysis of the complex sound.

Rise and fall: Effects of tone and intonation on spoken word recognition in early childhood,"Singh, L; Chee, M",2016,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"A crucial component of word learning is the ability to recognize words in spite of the varying forms they assume. This may be particularly challenging in tone languages as learners have to develop tone representations in the face of intonational variation in order to accurately recognize words. The effects of intonational variation on word recognition of tone-marked words in Mandarin Chinese were investigated in toddlers and preschoolers using a cross-sectional design. Participants were presented with known words where intonation (question/statement) and tone (rising/falling) were independently manipulated. Results demonstrated that word recognition in toddlers was heavily influenced by changes in the pitch contour of a tone due to intonational variation. In contrast, preschool were able to recognize tone-marked words regardless of simultaneous intonational variation, demonstrating a comparatively robust representation of lexical tone. Results chart an evolution in integrating pitch cues to tone and intonation over the first few years of life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Effects of Lexical Pitch Accent on Infant Word Recognition in Japanese,"Ota, M; Yamane, N; Mazuka, R",2018,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Learners of lexical tone languages (e.g., Mandarin) develop sensitivity to tonal contrasts and recognize pitch-matched, but not pitch-mismatched, familiar words by 11 months. Learners of non-tone languages (e.g., English) also show a tendency to treat pitch patterns as lexically contrastive up to about 18 months. In this study, we examined if this early-developing capacity to lexically encode pitch variations enables infants to acquire a pitch accent system, in which pitch-based lexical contrasts are obscured by the interaction of lexical and non-lexical (i.e., intonational) features. Eighteen 17-month-olds learning Tokyo Japanese were tested on their recognition of familiar words with the expected pitch or the lexically opposite pitch pattern. In early trials, infants were faster in shifting their eyegaze from the distractor object to the target object than in shifting from the target to distractor in the pitch-matched condition. In later trials, however, infants showed faster distractor-to-target than target-to-distractor shifts in both the pitch-matched and pitch-mismatched conditions.

Prosody in parsing morphologically complex words: Neurophysiological evidence,"Koester, D",2014,COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY,"Little is known about the neurophysiological correlates of lexical prosody in the comprehension of compound words, i.e., morphologically complex words. Here, it is investigated whether lexical prosody influences the decomposition of spoken compound words. In order to explore the neurophysiological correlates (event-related potentials, ERP) of a compound prosody, German native speakers had to judge the number agreement between numerals and nouns which did or did not agree in 50% of the cases. Importantly, the nouns carried either a compound or non-compound (single noun) prosody. The compound prosody led to increased reaction times (RTs) and reduced judgement accuracy. Critically, number violations for words with a compound prosody elicited an increased ERP negativity that was delayed by about 600ms relative to a left-anterior negativity elicited by number violations for a single noun prosody. The ERP effect for the compound prosody preceded the according behavioural response by about 200ms and the ERP peak latency effect correlated with the RT effect. These findings suggest that the ERP effect for the compound prosody could be functionally related to the accurate judgement performance for the compound prosody.

We propose three principles as those operating in the selection of the appropriate Chinese characters in writing unknown place names. The three principles are concerned with the combination of on and kun readings (zyuubako-yomi), the number of segmentations. and the bimoraicity characteristics of kanji chosen. We performed two experiments to test the principles: the results supported our hypotheses.

Atypical patterns of tone production in tone-language-speaking children with autism,"Xu, KY; Yan, JT; Ma, CL; Chang, XH; Chien, YF",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Speakers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are found to exhibit atypical pitch patterns in speech production. However, little is known about the production of lexical tones (T1, T2, T3, T4) as well as neutral tones (T1N, T2N, T3N, T4N) by tone-language speakers with ASD. Thus, this study investigated the height and shape of tones produced by Mandarin-speaking children with ASD and their age-matched typically developing (TD) peers. A pronunciation experiment was conducted in which the participants were asked to produce reduplicated nouns. The findings from the acoustic analyses showed that although ASD children generally produced both lexical tones and neutral tones with distinct tonal contours, there were significant differences between the ASD and TD groups for tone height and shape for T1/T1N, T3/T3N, and T4/T4N. However, we did not find any difference in T2/T2N. These data implied that the atypical acoustic pattern in the ASD group could be partially due to the suppression of the F0 range. Moreover, we found that ASD children tended to produce more errors for T2/T2N, T3/T3N than for T1/T1N, T4/T4N. The pattern of tone errors could be explained by the acquisition principle of pitch, similarities among different tones, and tone sandhi. We thus concluded that deficits in pitch processing could be responsible for the atypical tone pattern of ASD children, and speculated that the atypical tonal contours might also be due to imitation deficits. The present findings may eventually help enhance the comprehensive understanding of the representation of atypical pitch patterns in ASD across languages.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1023205,WOS:000886002800001,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",atypical patterns of tone production in tone language speaking children with autism,"Xu, KY",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1023205,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",2

Automatic methods of music analysis based on audio signal processing have the potential to assist researchers and to accelerate the transcription and analysis of music recordings significantly. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing improvised monophonic solos in multi-instrumental jazz recordings with special focus on reed and brass instruments. The analysis algorithms rely on prior score-information, which is taken from high quality manual solo transcriptions. Following an initial solo and accompaniment source separation, we propose algorithms for tone-wise extraction of fundamental frequency and intensity contours. Based on this fine-grained representation of recorded jazz solos, we perform several exploratory experiments motivated by questions relating to jazz research in order to analyze the use of expressive stylistic devices such as intonation, pitch modulation, and dynamics in jazz solos.

The special status of the tonic as a cognitive reference point brings into question the subtlety of listeners' tonal knowledge: Is the facilitated processing observed in priming studies limited to tonic events, or is tone processing influenced by subtler tonal contrasts? The present study investigated tonal priming for mediants (the third scale degree) over leading tones (the seventh scale degree) presented in melodic contexts. Experiment 1 used a timbre discrimination task and Experiment 2 an intonation task.

Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese,"Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,WOS:000813299300001,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",perception of different tone contrasts at sub lexical and lexical levels by dutch learners of mandarin chinese,"Zou, T",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Human cortical encoding of pitch in tonal and non-tonal languages,"Li, YN; Tang, C; Lu, JF; Wu, JS; Chang, EF",2021,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Languages can use a common repertoire of vocal sounds to signify distinct meanings. In tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, pitch contours of syllables distinguish one word from another, whereas in non-tonal languages, such as English, pitch is used to convey intonation. The neural computations underlying language specialization in speech perception are unknown. Here, we use a cross-linguistic approach to address this. Native Mandarin- and English- speaking participants each listened to both Mandarin and English speech, while neural activity was directly recorded from the non-primary auditory cortex. Both groups show language-general coding of speaker-invariant pitch at the single electrode level. At the electrode population level, we find language-specific distribution of cortical tuning parameters in Mandarin speakers only, with enhanced sensitivity to Mandarin tone categories. Our results show that speech perception relies upon a shared cortical auditory feature processing mechanism, which may be tuned to the statistics of a given language. Different languages rely on different vocal sounds to convey meaning.

Moreover, no evident form priming effect was observed in target words primed by real words with only tone contrasts (/lun2/-/lun4/).

"Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework","Deutsch, D; Henthorn, T",2004,MUSIC PERCEPTION,"Absolute pitch is generally considered to reflect a rare musical endowment; however, its characteristics are puzzling and its genesis is unclear. We describe two experiments in which native speakers of tone languages-Mandarin and Vietnamese-were found to display a remarkably precise and stable form of absolute pitch in enunciating words. We further describe a third experiment in which speakers of English displayed less stability on an analogous task. Based on these findings, and considering the related literatures on critical periods in speech development, and the neurological underpinnings of lexical tone, we propose a framework for the genesis of absolute pitch. The framework assumes that absolute pitch originally evolved as a feature of speech, analogous to other features such as vowel quality, and that speakers of tone language naturally acquire this feature during the critical period for speech acquisition. We further propose that the acquisition of absolute pitch by rare individuals who speak an intonation language may be associated with a critical period of unusually long duration, so that it encompasses the age at which the child can take music lessons. We conclude that the potential to acquire absolute pitch is universally present at birth, and that it can be realized by enabling the infant to associate pitches with verbal labels during the critical period for speech acquisition.",,,10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339,WOS:000220273000005,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",absolute pitch speech and tone language some experiments and a proposed framework,"Deutsch, D",doi:10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
"Why we need to investigate casual speech to truly understand language production, processing and the mental lexicon","Tucker, BV; Ernestus, M",2016,MENTAL LEXICON,"The majority of studies addressing psycholinguistic questions focus on speech produced and processed in a careful, laboratory speech style. This 'careful' speech is very different from the speech that listeners encounter in casual conversations. This article argues that research on casual speech is necessary to show the validity of conclusions based on careful speech. Moreover, research on casual speech produces new insights and questions on the processes underlying communication and on the mental lexicon that cannot be revealed by research using careful speech. This article first places research on casual speech in its historic perspective. It then provides many examples of how casual speech differs from careful speech and shows that these differences may have important implications for psycholinguistic theories. Subsequently, the article discusses the challenges that research on casual speech faces, which stem from the high variability of this speech style, its necessary casual context, and that casual speech is connected speech. We also present opportunities for research on casual speech, mostly in the form of new experimental methods that facilitate research on connected speech.

Using intracranial EEG recordings, we observed a significant FFR at the fundamental frequency (F0) for both speech and speech-like harmonic complex stimuli in the human auditory cortex, even in the missing fundamental condition. Both the spectral amplitude and phase coherence of the cortical FFR showed a significant harmonic preference, and attenuated from the primary auditory cortex to the surrounding associative auditory cortex. The phase coherence of the speech FFR was found significantly higher than that of the harmonic complex stimuli, especially in the left hemisphere, showing a high timing fidelity of the cortical FFR in tracking dynamic F0 in speech. Spectrally, the frequency band of the cortical FFR was largely overlapped with the range of the human vocal pitch.

Chinese-English Speakers' Perception of Pitch in Their Non-Tonal Language: Reinterpreting English as a Tonal-Like Language,"Ortega-Llebaria, M; Wu, ZH",2021,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"Changing the F0-contour of English words does not change their lexical meaning. However, it changes the meaning in tonal languages such as Mandarin. Given this important difference and knowing that words in the two languages of a bilingual lexicon interact, the question arises as to how Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in their bilingual lexicon. The few studies that addressed this question showed that Mandarin-English speakers did not perceive pitch in English words as native English speakers did. These studies, however, used English words as stimuli failing to examine nonwords and Mandarin words. Consequently, possible pre-lexical effects and L1 transfer were not ruled out. The present study fills this gap by examining pitch perception in Mandarin and English words and nonwords by Mandarin-English speakers and a group of native English controls. Results showed the tonal experience of Chinese-English speakers modulated their perception of pitch in their non-tonal language at both pre-lexical and lexical levels. In comparison to native English controls, tonal speakers were more sensitive to the acoustic salience of F0-contours in the pre-lexical processing due to top-down feedback. At the lexical level, Mandarin-English speakers organized words in their two languages according to similarity criteria based on both F0 and segmental information, whereas only the segmental information was relevant to the control group. These results in perception together with consistently reported production patterns in previous literature suggest that Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in English as if it was a one-tone language.",,,10.1177/0023830919894606,WOS:000507060400001,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",chinese english speakers perception of pitch in their non tonal language reinterpreting english as a tonal like language,"Ortega-Llebaria, M",doi:10.1177/0023830919894606,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Pitch contour impairment in congenital amusia: New insights from the Self-paced Audio-visual Contour Task (SACT),"Lu, XJ; Sun, YN; Ho, HT; Thompson, WF",2017,PLOS ONE,"Individuals with congenital amusia usually exhibit impairments in melodic contour processing when asked to compare pairs of melodies that may or may not be identical to one another. However, it is unclear whether the impairment observed in contour processing is caused by an impairment of pitch discrimination, or is a consequence of poor pitch memory. To help resolve this ambiguity, we designed a novel Self-paced Audio-visual Contour Task (SACT) that evaluates sensitivity to contour while placing minimal burden on memory. In this task, participants control the pace of an auditory contour that is simultaneously accompanied by a visual contour, and they are asked to judge whether the two contours are congruent or incongruent. In Experiment 1, melodic contours varying in pitch were presented with a series of dots that varied in spatial height. Amusics exhibited reduced sensitivity to audio-visual congruency in comparison to control participants. To exclude the possibility that the impairment arises from a general deficit in cross-modal mapping, Experiment 2 examined sensitivity to cross-modal mapping for two other auditory dimensions: timbral brightness and loudness. Amusics and controls were significantly more sensitive to large than small contour changes, and to changes in loudness than changes in timbre. However, there were no group differences in cross-modal mapping, suggesting that individuals with congenital amusia can comprehend spatial representations of acoustic information.

Brainstem encoding of speech and musical stimuli in congenital amusia: evidence from Cantonese speakers,"Liu, F; Maggu, AR; Lau, JCY; Wong, PCM",2015,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,"Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical processing that also impacts subtle aspects of speech processing. It remains debated at what stage(s) of auditory processing deficits in amusia arise. In this study, we investigated whether amusia originates from impaired subcortical encoding of speech On quiet and noise) and musical sounds in the brainstem. Fourteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 14 matched controls passively listened to six Cantonese lexical tones in quiet, two Cantonese tones in noise (signal-to-noise ratios at 0 and 20 dB), and two cello tones in quiet while their frequency-following responses (FFRs) to these tones were recorded. All participants also completed a behavioral lexical tone identification task. The results indicated normal brainstem encoding of pitch in speech On quiet and noise) and musical stimuli in amusics relative to controls, as measured by FFR pitch strength, pitch error, and stimulus-to-response correlation. There was also no group difference in neural conduction time or FFR amplitudes. Both groups demonstrated better FFRs to speech On quiet and noise) than to musical stimuli. However, a significant group difference was observed for tone identification, with amusics showing significantly lower accuracy than controls. Analysis of the tone confusion matrices suggested that amusics were more likely than controls to confuse between tones that shared similar acoustic features. Interestingly, this deficit in lexical tone identification was not coupled with brainstem abnormality for either speech or musical stimuli. Together, our results suggest that the amusic brainstem is not functioning abnormally, although higher-order linguistic pitch processing is impaired in amusia.

The role of lexical stress in spoken English word recognition by listeners of English and Taiwan Mandarin,"Ou, SC",2019,LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS,"Two perceptual experiments investigated how the suprasegmental information of monosyllables is perceived and exploited in spoken English word recognition by listeners of English and Taiwan Mandarin (TM). Using an auditory lexical decision task in which correctly stressed English words and mis-stressed nonwords (e.g. camPAIGN vs. *CAMpaign) were presented for lexical decisions, Experiment I demonstrated that TM listeners could perceive the differences between stressed and unstressed syllables with native-like accuracy and rapidity. To examine how the perceived suprasegmental contrast would constrain English lexical access, Experiment II was conducted. It used a cross-modal fragment priming task in which a lexical decision had to be made for a visually presented English word or nonword following an auditory prime, which was a spoken word-initial syllable. The results showed that English and TM listeners recognized the displayed word (e.g. campus) faster both after a stress-matching (e.g. CAM-) prime and a stress-mismatching (e.g. cam-) prime than after a control prime (e.g. MOUN , with mismatching segments). This indicates that suprasegmental information does not inhibit a segmentally matching but suprasegmentally mismatching word candidate for both the two groups, although TM is a language where lexical prosody is expressed syllabically and its listeners tend to interpret lexical stress tonally. Yet, the two groups' responses were slower after the stressed primes than after the unstressed ones, presumably because the former generally had more possible continuations than the latter do. It is therefore concluded that when recognizing spoken English words, both the native and non-native (TM-speaking) listeners can exploit the suprasegmental cues of monosyllables, which, however, are not so effective that they will outweigh the segmental cues.",,,10.1075/lali.00049.ou,WOS:000496239100003,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",the role of lexical stress in spoken english word recognition by listeners of english and taiwan mandarin,"Ou, SC",doi:10.1075/lali.00049.ou,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
Talker normalization in typical Cantonese-speaking listeners and congenital amusics: Evidence from event-related potentials,"Shao, J; Zhang, CC",2019,NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL,"Despite the lack of invariance in the mapping between the acoustic signal and phonological representation, typical listeners are capable of using information of a talker's vocal characteristics to recognize phonemes, a process known as ""talker normalization"". The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100-150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the ""active control theory"". On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual ""anchoring"" deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.",,,10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814,WOS:000485804400006,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",talker normalization in typical cantonese speaking listeners and congenital amusics evidence from event related potentials,"Shao, J",doi:10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Mental representations of speech and musical pitch contours reveal a diversity of profiles in autism spectrum disorder,"Wang, L; Ong, JH; Ponsot, E; Hou, QQ; Jiang, CM; Liu, F",2023,AUTISM,"As an information-bearing auditory attribute of sound, pitch plays a crucial role in the perception of speech and music. Studies examining pitch processing in autism spectrum disorder have produced equivocal results. To understand this discrepancy from a mechanistic perspective, we used a novel data-driven method, the reverse-correlation paradigm, to explore whether the equivocal findings in autism spectrum disorder have high-level origins in top-down comparisons of internal mental representations of pitch contours. Thirty-two Mandarin-speaking autistic individuals and 32 non-autistic individuals undertook three subtasks testing mental representations of pitch contours in speech, complex tone and melody, respectively. The results indicate that while the two groups exhibited similar representations of pitch contours across the three conditions, the autistic group showed a significantly higher intra-group variability than the non-autistic group. In addition, the two groups did not differ significantly in internal noise, a measure of the robustness of participant responses to external variability, suggesting that the present findings translate genuinely qualitative differences and similarities between groups in pitch processing. These findings uncover for the first time that pitch patterns in speech and music are mentally represented in a similar manner in autistic and non-autistic individuals, through domain-general top-down mechanisms. Lay abstract As a key auditory attribute of sounds, pitch is ubiquitous in our everyday listening experience involving language, music and environmental sounds. Given its critical role in auditory processing related to communication, numerous studies have investigated pitch processing in autism spectrum disorder. However, the findings have been mixed, reporting either enhanced, typical or impaired performance among autistic individuals. By investigating top-down comparisons of internal mental representations of pitch contours in speech and music, this study shows for the first time that, while autistic individuals exhibit diverse profiles of pitch processing compared to non-autistic individuals, their mental representations of pitch contours are typical across domains. These findings suggest that pitch-processing mechanisms are shared across domains in autism spectrum disorder and provide theoretical implications for using music to improve speech for those autistic individuals who have language problems.",,,10.1177/13623613221111207,WOS:000826666900001,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",mental representations of speech and musical pitch contours reveal a diversity of profiles in autism spectrum disorder,"Wang, L",doi:10.1177/13623613221111207,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody""))",2
Rise and fall: Effects of tone and intonation on spoken word recognition in early childhood,"Singh, L; Chee, M",2016,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"A crucial component of word learning is the ability to recognize words in spite of the varying forms they assume. This may be particularly challenging in tone languages as learners have to develop tone representations in the face of intonational variation in order to accurately recognize words. The effects of intonational variation on word recognition of tone-marked words in Mandarin Chinese were investigated in toddlers and preschoolers using a cross-sectional design. Participants were presented with known words where intonation (question/statement) and tone (rising/falling) were independently manipulated. Results demonstrated that word recognition in toddlers was heavily influenced by changes in the pitch contour of a tone due to intonational variation. In contrast, preschool were able to recognize tone-marked words regardless of simultaneous intonational variation, demonstrating a comparatively robust representation of lexical tone.

"The interaction of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context in on-line spoken word recognition: An ERP study on Cantonese Chinese","Kung, C; Chwilla, DJ; Schriefers, H",2014,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"In two ERP experiments, we investigate the on-line interplay of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context during spoken word recognition in Cantonese Chinese. Experiment 1 shows that lexical tone and intonation interact immediately. Words with a low lexical tone at the end of questions (with a rising question intonation) lead to a processing conflict. This is reflected in a low accuracy in lexical identification and in a P600 effect compared to the same words at the end of a statement. Experiment 2 shows that a strongly biasing semantic context leads to much better lexical-identification performance for words with a low tone at the end of questions and to a disappearance of the P600 effect. These results support the claim that semantic context plays a major role in disentangling the tonal information from the intonational information, and thus, in resolving the on-line conflict between intonation and tone. However, the ERP data indicate that the introduction of a semantic context does not entirely eliminate on-line processing problems for words at the end of questions. This is revealed by the presence of an N400 effect for words with a low lexical tone and for words with a high-mid lexical tone at the end of questions. The ERP data thus show that, while semantic context helps in the eventual lexical identification, it makes the deviation of the contextually expected lexical tone from the actual acoustic signal more salient.

Context Matters for Tone and Intonation Processing in Mandarin,"Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO",2022,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"In tonal languages such as Mandarin, both lexical tone and sentence intonation are primarily signaled by F0. Their F0 encodings are sometimes in conflict and sometimes in congruency. The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that top-down information provided by the semantically constraining context can play a facilitating role for listeners to disentangle intonational information from tonal information, but mainly in sentences with the lexical falling tone in the final position.",,,10.1177/0023830920986174,WOS:000618452600001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation)",context matters for tone and intonation processing in mandarin,"Liu, M",doi:10.1177/0023830920986174,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non-tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2020,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Intonation, the modulation of pitch in speech, is a crucial aspect of language that is processed in right-hemispheric regions, beyond the classical left-hemispheric language system. Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.",,,10.1002/hbm.24916,WOS:000508026600001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation)",neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ",doi:10.1002/hbm.24916,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese,"Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,WOS:000813299300001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation)",perception of different tone contrasts at sub lexical and lexical levels by dutch learners of mandarin chinese,"Zou, T",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4
Pitch shape modulates the time course of tone vs pitch-accent identification in Mandarin Chinese,"Wu, ZH; Ortega-Llebaria, M",2017,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"In Mandarin Chinese pitch is used to express both lexical meanings via tones and sentence-level meanings via pitch-accents raising the question of which information is processed first. While research with meaningful sentence materials suggested a general processing advantage of tone over pitch-accents, research on pure tones and nonce speech in pre-attentive processing found that the f0-shape led to timing and site processing differences. The current study reconciles these results by exploring whether the tone advantage found in meaningful speech materials is modulated by the f0-shape by establishing via a gating paradigm the relative timing of tone and pitch-accent identification. Target words containing static (T1) and dynamic (T2, T4) tones were embedded into meaningful sentences and were divided into 50 ms gates which were added incrementally either from the left-or right-edge of the target word. Results showed that dynamic targets had either a tone or pitch-accent advantage contingent on the direction of gate processing. In contrast, for static T1 targets, tone and pitch-accent were identified simultaneously regardless of the direction of gate processing. Altogether, these results indicate that the f0-shape, as defined by pitch dimensions of f0 and pitch range, mediates the timing of tone and pitch-accent identification in meaningful speech supporting highly interactive models of speech perception.

Spoken word recognition in young tone language learners: Age-dependent effects of segmental and suprasegmental variation,"Ma, WY; Zhou, P; Singh, L; Gao, LQ",2017,COGNITION,"The majority of the world's languages rely on both segmental (vowels, consonants) and suprasegmental (lexical tones) information to contrast the meanings of individual words. However, research on early language development has mostly focused on the acquisition of vowel-consonant languages. Developmental research comparing sensitivity to segmental and suprasegmental features in young tone learners is extremely rare. This study examined 2- and 3-year-old monolingual tone learners' sensitivity to vowels and tones. Experiment la tested the influence of vowel and tone variation on novel word learning. Vowel and tone variation hindered word recognition efficiency in both age groups. However, tone variation hindered word recognition accuracy only in 2-year-olds, while 3-year-olds were insensitive to tone variation. Experiment 1b demonstrated that 3-year-olds could use tones to learn new words when additional support was provided, and additionally, that Tone 3 words were exceptionally difficult to learn. Experiment 2 confirmed a similar pattern of results when children were presented with familiar words. This study is the first to show that despite the importance of tones in tone languages, vowels maintain primacy over tones in young children's word recognition and that tone sensitivity in word learning and recognition changes between 2 and 3 years of age. The findings suggest that early lexical processes are more tightly constrained by variation in vowels than by tones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Influence of Tonal and Atonal Bilingualism on Children's Lexical and Non-Lexical Tone Perception,"Morett, LM",2020,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"This study examined how bilingualism in an atonal language, in addition to a tonal language, influences lexical and non-lexical tone perception and word learning during childhood. Forty children aged 5;3-7;2, bilingual either in English and Mandarin or English and another atonal language, were tested on Mandarin lexical tone discrimination, level-pitch sine-wave tone discrimination, and learning of novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone. Mandarin-English bilingual children discriminated between and learned novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone more accurately than their atonal-English bilingual peers. However, Mandarin-English and atonal-English bilingual children discriminated between level-pitch sine-wave tones with similar accuracy. Moreover, atonal-English bilingual children showed a tendency to perceive differing Mandarin lexical and level-pitch sine-wave tones as identical, whereas their Mandarin-English peers showed no such tendency. These results indicate that bilingualism in a tonal language in addition to an atonal language-but not bilingualism in two atonal languages-allows for continued sensitivity to lexical tone beyond infancy. Moreover, they suggest that although tonal-atonal bilingualism does not enhance sensitivity to differences in pitch between sine-wave tones beyond infancy any more effectively than atonal-atonal bilingualism, it protects against the development of biases to perceive differing lexical and non-lexical tones as identical. Together, the results indicate that, beyond infancy, tonal-atonal bilinguals process lexical tones using different cognitive mechanisms than atonal-atonal bilinguals, but that both groups process level-pitch non-lexical tone using the same cognitive mechanisms.",,,10.1177/0023830919834679,WOS:000537760600002,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation)",the influence of tonal and atonal bilingualism on children s lexical and non lexical tone perception,"Morett, LM",doi:10.1177/0023830919834679,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
The Acquisition of Contrastive Focus During Online Sentence-Comprehension by Children Learning Mandarin Chinese,"Tang, P; Yuen, I; Demuth, K; Rattanasone, NX",2023,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,"Contrastive focus, conveyed by prosodic cues, marks important information. Studies have shown that 6-year-olds learning English and Japanese can use contrastive focus during online sentence comprehension: focus used in a contrastive context facilitates the identification of a target referent (speeding up processing), whereas focus used inappropriately in a noncontrastive context misleads listeners to predict an incorrect referent, hindering the identification process (Ito et al., 2012, 2014). In Mandarin Chinese, the mapping between prosodic form and contrastive focus is less transparent, potentially delaying the acquisition of contrastive focus. This study assessed the online processing of contrastive focus by 196 Mandarin-speaking 4-10-year-olds and 34 adults in China, using the visual world paradigm. Stimuli contained a target NP in a mini discourse, with focus being used in contrastive (Experiment 1) versus Noncontrastive contexts (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that the appropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus facilitated the identification of a target referent for 7-10-year-olds and adults, though not younger children. Experiment 2 showed that the inappropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus slowed the identification process only for 10-year-olds and adults. Thus, whereas 7-10-year-olds are sensitive to prosodic form for contrastive focus, only 10-year-olds use it as a primary cue to predict an upcoming referent like adults. The acquisition of contrastive focus in Mandarin is therefore a gradual process, with children showing sensitivity to contrastive focus during the early school years, and developing adult-like form-function mapping between prosody and focus until the end of primary school.",,,10.1037/dev0001498,WOS:000894788700001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation)",the acquisition of contrastive focus during online sentence comprehension by children learning mandarin chinese,"Tang, P",doi:10.1037/dev0001498,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2

There has been recent interest in tracking the development of tone categories during infancy. These studies have focused largely on monolingual infants learning either a tone language or a non-tone language. It remains to be seen how bilingual infants learning one tone language (e.g., Mandarin) and one non-tone language (e.g., English) discriminate tones. Here, we examined infants' discrimination of two Mandarin tones pairs: one salient and one subtle. Discrimination was investigated in three groups: Mandarin-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and Mandarin monolinguals at 6 months and 9 months of age in a cross-sectional design. Results demonstrated relatively strong Mandarin tone discrimination in Mandarin monolinguals, with salient tone discrimination at 6 months and both salient and subtle tone discrimination at 9 months. English monolinguals discriminated neither contrast at 6 months but discriminated the salient contrast at 9 months. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for tone discrimination in Mandarin-English bilingual infants. In a second experiment, 12- and 13-month-old Mandarin-English bilingual and English monolingual infants were tested to determine whether bilinguals would demonstrate tone sensitivity at a later age. Results revealed a lack of tone sensitivity at 12 or 13 months in bilingual infants, yet English monolingual infants were sensitive to both salient and subtle Mandarin tone contrasts at 12 or 13 months. Our findings provide evidence for age-related convergence in Mandarin tone discrimination in English and Mandarin monolingual infants and for a distinct pattern of tone discrimination in bilingual infants. Theoretical implications for phonetic category acquisition are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Growth curve analysis was used to characterize the trajectory of looks to target and competitor items during word processing. We found similar model fits for the segmental and cohort conditions characterized by slower eye movements to correct targets compared to baseline, suggesting that tonal and segmental information are accessed concurrently and play comparable roles in constraining activation.

Flow of information in the spoken word recognition system,"McQueen, JM; Cutler, A; Norris, D",2003,SPEECH COMMUNICATION,"Spoken word recognition consists of two major component processes. First, at the prelexical stage, an abstract description of the utterance is generated from the information in the speech signal. Second, at the lexical stage, this description is used to activate all the words stored in the mental lexicon which match the input. These multiple candidate words then compete with each other. We review evidence which suggests that positive (match) and negative (mismatch) information of both a segmental and a suprasegmental nature is used to constrain this activation and competition process. We then ask whether, in addition to the necessary influence of the prelexical stage on the lexical stage, there is also feedback from the lexicon to the prelexical level. In two phonetic categorization experiments, Dutch listeners were asked to label both syllable-initial and syllable-final ambiguous fricatives (e.g., sounds ranging from [f] to [s]) in the word-nonword series maf-mas, and the nonword-word series jaf-jas. They tended to label the sounds in a lexically consistent manner (i.e., consistent with the word endpoints of the series). These lexical effects became smaller in listeners' slower responses, even when the listeners were put under pressure to respond as fast as possible. Our results challenge models of spoken word recognition in which feedback modulates the prelexical analysis of the component sounds of a word whenever that word is heard.

"From ""I dance"" to ""she danced"" with a flick of the hands: Audiovisual stress perception in Spanish","Rohrer, PL; Bujok, R; van Maastricht, L; Bosker, HR",2025,PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,"When talking, speakers naturally produce hand movements (co-speech gestures) that contribute to communication. Evidence in Dutch suggests that the timing of simple up-and-down, non-referential ""beat"" gestures influences spoken word recognition: the same auditory stimulus was perceived as CONtent (noun, capitalized letters indicate stressed syllables) when a beat gesture occurred on the first syllable, but as conTENT (adjective) when the gesture occurred on the second syllable. However, these findings were based on a small number of minimal pairs in Dutch, limiting the generalizability of the findings. We therefore tested this effect in Spanish, where lexical stress is highly relevant in the verb conjugation system, distinguishing bailo, ""I dance"" with word-initial stress from bail & oacute;, ""she danced"" with word-final stress. Testing a larger sample (N = 100), we also assessed whether individual differences in working memory capacity modulated how much individuals relied on the gestures in spoken word recognition. The results showed that, similar to Dutch, Spanish participants were biased to perceive lexical stress on the syllable that visually co-occurred with a beat gesture, with the effect being strongest when the acoustic stress cues were most ambiguous. No evidence was found for by-participant effect sizes to be influenced by individual differences in phonological or visuospatial working memory.

Are Prosodic Variants Stored in the French Mental Lexicon?,"Michelas, A; Dufour, S",2019,EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,"A long-term priming experiment examined the way stress information is processed and represented in French speakers' mind. Repeated prime and target words either matched (/ba'do/ - /ba'do/ ""headband"") or mismatched their stress pattern (/bado/ - /ba'do/). In comparison to a control condition (/makc/ - /ba'do/), the results showed that matching and mismatching primes were equally effective in facilitating the processing of the target words. Thus, despite the fact that French speakers routinely produce and hear words in their stressed and unstressed versions, this study suggests that stress in French is not integrated into lexical representations.",,,10.1027/1618-3169/a000462,WOS:000514569700002,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",are prosodic variants stored in the french mental lexicon,"Michelas, A",doi:10.1027/1618-3169/a000462,"TS=(""mental lexicon"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
Does horse activate mother? Processing lexical tone in form priming,"Lee, CY",2007,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"Lexical tone languages make up the majority of all known languages of the world, but the role of tone in lexical processing remains unclear. In the present study, four form priming experiments examined the role of Mandarin tones in constraining lexical activation and the time course of the activation. When a prime and a target were related directly in form (e.g., lou3 'hug'-lou2 'hall'), competitors that differed from the prime in tone failed to be activated, indicating the use of tonal information to distinguish between segmentally identical words. When a prime and a target were not form-related but were related through a third word that was not actually presented (e.g., lou3 'hug'-jian4zhu0 'building', where lou3 is form-related to lou2 'hall', which was semantically related to jian4zhu0), a mismatch in tone prevented activation of minimal tone pairs at 250 ms interstimulus interval (ISI) but did not prevent activation at 50 ms ISI. These results indicate that tonal information is used on-line to reduce the number of activated candidates, but does not prevent the minimal tone pairs from being activated in the early phase of lexical activation.",,,10.1177/00238309070500010501,WOS:000246228200005,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",does horse activate mother processing lexical tone in form priming,"Lee, CY",doi:10.1177/00238309070500010501,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
The perception of primary and secondary stress in English,"Mattys, SL",2000,PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,"Most models of word recognition concerned with prosody are based on a distinction between strong syllables (containing a full vowel) and weak syllables (containing a schwa). In these models,the posslibility that listeners take advantage of finer grained prosodic distinctions, such as primary versus secondary stress, is usually rejected on the grounds that these two categories are not discriminable from each other without lexical information or normalization of the speaker's voice. In the present experiment, subjects were presented with word fragments that differed only by their degree of stress-namely, primary or secondary stress (e.g., /'prasi/ vs. /""prasi/). The task was to guess the origin of the fragment (e.g., ""prosecutor"" vs. ""prosecution""). The results showed that guessing performance: significantly exceeds the chance level, which indicates that making fine stress distinctions is possible without lexical information and with minimal speech normalization This finding is discussed in the framework of prosody-based word recognition theories.",,,10.3758/bf03205547,WOS:000085653500002,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",the perception of primary and secondary stress in english,"Mattys, SL",doi:10.3758/bf03205547,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
Pitch accent in spoken-word recognition in Japanese,"Cutler, A; Otake, T",1999,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Three experiments addressed the question of whether pitch-accent information may be exploited in the process of recognizing spoken words in Tokyo Japanese. In a two-choice classification task, listeners judged from which of two words, differing in accentual structure, isolated syllables had been extracted (e.g., ka from baka HL or gaka LH); most judgments were correct, and listeners' decisions were correlated with the fundamental frequency characteristics of the syllables. In a gating experiment, listeners heard initial fragments of words and guessed what the words were; their guesses overwhelmingly had the same initial accent structure as the gated word even when only the beginning CV of the stimulus (e.g., na- from nagasa HLL or nagashi LHH) was presented. In addition, listeners were more confident in guesses with the same initial accent structure as the stimulus than in guesses with different accent. In a lexical decision experiment, responses to spoken words (e.g., ame HL) were speeded by previous presentation of the same word (e.g., ame HL) but not by previous presentation of a word differing only in accent (e.g., ame LH). Together these findings provide strong evidence that accentual information constrains the activation and selection of candidates for spoken-word recognition. (C) 1999 Acoustical Society of America.

We assumed Accent I to be lexically specified for a subset of words and hypothesized that this specification would speed up word accent identification.

SYNTACTIC TONE AND DISCOURSE PROCESSING IN BEIJING MANDARIN: A CASE STUDY,"Tao, L",2009,JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS,"Three experiments tested the role of an emerging syntactic tone in spoken word recognition of Beijing Mandarin Chinese. The study examined the role of the new syntactic tone in lexical access and how synchronic change is perceived in the task of word recognition. Experiment 1 used an information-deprived condition where information for the standard interpretation of the word was provided prior to the crucial tone, but the syntactic tone based interpretation was not provided. Experiment 2 used a prosody-reduced condition where the prosodic cues were unclear while information for both standard and syntactic tone based interpretation was provided. Experiment 3 involved a story retell task to further assess tone comprehension. The results show that the emerging syntactic tone had an impact on participant's lexical interpretations, although the impact was more obvious when prosody information was clearly provided. The results also confirmed participants' tone comprehension through story retells. The results support the hypotheses that a) there is a new syntactic tone in spoken Beijing Mandarin whose function goes beyond lexical tone, which has become a precursor for word recognition in discourse processing; and, b) language processing reflects asymmetry in that speakers prefer the traditional grammatical interpretation more than the interpretation derived from the newly developed syntactic tone when prosodic information is unclear.

Phonological and conceptual activation in speech comprehension,"Norris, D; Cutler, A; McQueen, JM; Butterfield, S",2006,COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,"We propose that speech comprehension involves the activation of token representations of the phonological forms of current lexical hypotheses, separately from the ongoing construction of a conceptual interpretation of the current utterance. In a series of cross-modal priming experiments, facilitation of lexical decision responses to visual target words (e.g., time) was found for targets that were semantic associates of auditory prime words (e.g., date) when the primes were isolated words, but not when the same primes appeared in sentence contexts. Identity priming (e.g., faster lexical decisions to visual date after spoken date than after an unrelated prime) appeared, however, both with isolated primes and with primes in prosodically neutral sentences. Associative priming in sentence contexts only emerged when sentence prosody involved contrastive accents, or when sentences were terminated immediately after the prime. Associative priming is therefore not an automatic consequence of speech processing. In no experiment was there associative priming from embedded words (e.g., sedate-time), but there was inhibitory identity priming (e.g., sedate-date) from embedded primes in sentence contexts. Speech comprehension therefore appears to involve separate distinct activation both of token phonological word representations and of conceptual word representations. Furthermore, both of these types of representation are distinct from the long-term memory representations of word form and meaning. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non-tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2020,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Intonation, the modulation of pitch in speech, is a crucial aspect of language that is processed in right-hemispheric regions, beyond the classical left-hemispheric language system. Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.",,,10.1002/hbm.24916,WOS:000508026600001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ",doi:10.1002/hbm.24916,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4

The Role of Semantic Transparency in the Processing of Spoken Compound Words,"Creemers, A; Embick, D",2022,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION,"The question of whether lexical decomposition is driven by semantic transparency in the lexical processing of morphologically complex words, such as compounds, remains controversial. Prior research on compound processing has predominantly examined visual processing. Focusing instead on spoken word word recognition, the present study examined the processing of auditorily presented English compounds that were semantically transparent (e.g., farmyard) or partially opaque with an opaque head (e.g., airline) or opaque modifier (e.g., pothole). Three auditory primed lexical decision experiments were run to examine to what extent constituent priming effects are affected by the semantic transparency of a compound and whether semantic transparency affects the processing of heads and modifiers equally. The results showed priming effects for both modifiers and heads regardless of their semantic transparency, indicating that individual constituents are accessed in transparent as well as opaque compounds. In addition, the results showed smaller priming effects for semantically opaque heads compared with matched transparent compounds with the same head. These findings suggest that semantically opaque heads induce an increased processing cost, which may result from the need to suppress the meaning of the head in favor of the meaning of the opaque compound.",,,10.1037/xlm0001132,WOS:000778682100001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",the role of semantic transparency in the processing of spoken compound words,"Creemers, A",doi:10.1037/xlm0001132,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
Perceptual Recovery from Consonant-Cluster Simplification in Korean Using Language-Specific Phonological Knowledge,"Cho, T; McQueen, JM",2011,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH,"Two experiments examined whether perceptual recovery from Korean consonant-cluster simplification is based on language-specific phonological knowledge. In tri-consonantal C1C2C3 sequences such as /lkt/ and /lpt/ in Seoul Korean, either C1 or C2 can be completely deleted. Seoul Koreans monitored for C2 targets (/p/ or /k/, deleted or preserved) in the second word of a two-word phrase with an underlying /l/-C2-/t/ sequence. In Experiment 1 the target-bearing words had contextual lexical-semantic support. Listeners recovered deleted targets as fast and as accurately as preserved targets with both Word and Intonational Phrase (IP) boundaries between the two words. In Experiment 2, contexts were low-pass filtered. Listeners were still able to recover deleted targets as well as preserved targets in IP-boundary contexts, but better with physically-present targets than with deleted targets in Word-boundary contexts. This suggests that the benefit of having target acoustic-phonetic information emerges only when higher-order (contextual and phrase-boundary) information is not available. The strikingly efficient recovery of deleted phonemes with neither acoustic-phonetic cues nor contextual support demonstrates that language-specific phonological knowledge, rather than language-universal perceptual processes which rely on fine-grained phonetic details, is employed when the listener perceives the results of a continuous-speech process in which reduction is phonetically complete.",,,10.1007/s10936-011-9168-0,WOS:000300174300002,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",perceptual recovery from consonant cluster simplification in korean using language specific phonological knowledge,"Cho, T",doi:10.1007/s10936-011-9168-0,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
The Acquisition of Contrastive Focus During Online Sentence-Comprehension by Children Learning Mandarin Chinese,"Tang, P; Yuen, I; Demuth, K; Rattanasone, NX",2023,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,"Contrastive focus, conveyed by prosodic cues, marks important information. Studies have shown that 6-year-olds learning English and Japanese can use contrastive focus during online sentence comprehension: focus used in a contrastive context facilitates the identification of a target referent (speeding up processing), whereas focus used inappropriately in a noncontrastive context misleads listeners to predict an incorrect referent, hindering the identification process (Ito et al., 2012, 2014). In Mandarin Chinese, the mapping between prosodic form and contrastive focus is less transparent, potentially delaying the acquisition of contrastive focus. This study assessed the online processing of contrastive focus by 196 Mandarin-speaking 4-10-year-olds and 34 adults in China, using the visual world paradigm. Stimuli contained a target NP in a mini discourse, with focus being used in contrastive (Experiment 1) versus Noncontrastive contexts (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that the appropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus facilitated the identification of a target referent for 7-10-year-olds and adults, though not younger children. Experiment 2 showed that the inappropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus slowed the identification process only for 10-year-olds and adults. Thus, whereas 7-10-year-olds are sensitive to prosodic form for contrastive focus, only 10-year-olds use it as a primary cue to predict an upcoming referent like adults. The acquisition of contrastive focus in Mandarin is therefore a gradual process, with children showing sensitivity to contrastive focus during the early school years, and developing adult-like form-function mapping between prosody and focus until the end of primary school.",,,10.1037/dev0001498,WOS:000894788700001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",the acquisition of contrastive focus during online sentence comprehension by children learning mandarin chinese,"Tang, P",doi:10.1037/dev0001498,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",3
Features of low functional load in mono- and bilinguals' lexical access: evidence from Swedish tonal accent,"Althaus, N; Wetterlin, A; Lahiri, A",2021,PHONETICA,"Swedish makes use of tonal accents (Accents 1 and 2) to contrast words, but the functional load is very low, with some regional dialects not even exhibiting the contrast. In particular given the low number of minimal pairs, the question is whether tonal word accent is used in lexical access. Here we present two cross-modal fragment semantic priming studies in order to address this question. Both experiments use first syllable fragments in order to prime semantically related targets. Experiment 1 utilises words whose first syllable occurs with both accent patterns, creating a situation in which there is lexical competition between words that differ solely in terms of accent. Experiment 2 removes this competition by using words that have no such accent competitors. Our results show that native speakers of Swedish use tonal word accent in lexical access: Accent mispronunciations failed to prime semantically related targets, regardless of whether primes had accent competitors or not. Results for a group of early bilingual speakers (who grew up with one Swedish-speaking parent and one other non-tonal language) showed no differences in processing compared to the monolinguals. This indicates that the extraction of accent features during acquisition and their use in lexical access is robust, even in a scenario where multiple input languages lead to tonal word accent being a useful feature for only some of the lexical items that are being acquired. There is no doubt that the accent system is well entrenched into the bilinguals' phonological system.",,,10.1515/phon-2021-2002,WOS:000705492900001,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",features of low functional load in mono and bilinguals lexical access evidence from swedish tonal accent,"Althaus, N",doi:10.1515/phon-2021-2002,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
The role of lexical stress in spoken English word recognition by listeners of English and Taiwan Mandarin,"Ou, SC",2019,LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS,"Two perceptual experiments investigated how the suprasegmental information of monosyllables is perceived and exploited in spoken English word recognition by listeners of English and Taiwan Mandarin (TM). Using an auditory lexical decision task in which correctly stressed English words and mis-stressed nonwords (e.g. camPAIGN vs. *CAMpaign) were presented for lexical decisions, Experiment I demonstrated that TM listeners could perceive the differences between stressed and unstressed syllables with native-like accuracy and rapidity. To examine how the perceived suprasegmental contrast would constrain English lexical access, Experiment II was conducted. It used a cross-modal fragment priming task in which a lexical decision had to be made for a visually presented English word or nonword following an auditory prime, which was a spoken word-initial syllable. The results showed that English and TM listeners recognized the displayed word (e.g. campus) faster both after a stress-matching (e.g. CAM-) prime and a stress-mismatching (e.g. cam-) prime than after a control prime (e.g. MOUN , with mismatching segments). This indicates that suprasegmental information does not inhibit a segmentally matching but suprasegmentally mismatching word candidate for both the two groups, although TM is a language where lexical prosody is expressed syllabically and its listeners tend to interpret lexical stress tonally. Yet, the two groups' responses were slower after the stressed primes than after the unstressed ones, presumably because the former generally had more possible continuations than the latter do. It is therefore concluded that when recognizing spoken English words, both the native and non-native (TM-speaking) listeners can exploit the suprasegmental cues of monosyllables, which, however, are not so effective that they will outweigh the segmental cues.",,,10.1075/lali.00049.ou,WOS:000496239100003,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",the role of lexical stress in spoken english word recognition by listeners of english and taiwan mandarin,"Ou, SC",doi:10.1075/lali.00049.ou,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",3

Therefore we considered children's ability to confirm or override a context-based hypothesis based on linguistic information. Our objective in this study was to test (1) children's (ages 4-6) ability to form a hypothesis based on contextual information, (2) their ability to override such a hypothesis based on linguistic information and (3) how children are able to use different types of linguistic cues (morphosyntactic versus prosodic) to confirm or override the initial hypothesis. Results from both offline (pointing) and online (eye tracking) tasks suggest that children in this age group indeed form hypotheses based on contextual information. Age effects were found regarding children's ability to override these hypotheses. Overall, 4-year-olds were not shown to be able to override their hypotheses using linguistic information of interest. For 5- and 6-year-olds, it depended on the types of linguistic cues that were available to them. Children were better at using morphosyntactic cues to override an initial hypothesis than they were at using prosodic cues to do so. Our results suggest that children slowly develop the ability to override hypotheses based on early-arriving information, even when that information is extralinguistic and contextual. Children must learn to weight different types of cues in an adult-like way. This developmental period of learning to prioritize different cues in an adult-like way is consistent with a constraint-based model of learning.",,,10.1515/probus-2016-0004,WOS:000375180700004,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",children s processing of morphosyntactic and prosodic cues in overriding context based hypotheses an eye tracking study,"Armstrong, ME",doi:10.1515/probus-2016-0004,"TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody)",2
The effect of lexical tone experience on English intonation perception in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children,"Lu, HP; Lin, CS; Wu, CM; Peng, SC; Feng, IJ; Lin, YS",2022,MEDICINE,"To examine the effect of lexical tone experience on English intonation perception in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children during second language acquisition in Taiwan.

Cochlear implantation and hearing rehabilitation. Two speech recognition accuracies were examined: (1) Lexical tone recognition (4-alternative forced choice, AFC), (2) English Sentence Intonation (2AFC). The overall accuracies for tone perception are 61.13% (standard deviation, SD = 10.84%) for CI group and 93.82% (SD = 1.80%) for normal hearing group. Tone 4 and Tone 1 were more easily to be recognized than tone 2 and tone 3 in the pediatric CI recipients (cCI) group. In English intonation perception, the overall accuracies are 61.82% (SD = 16.85%) for CI group, and 97.59% (SD = 4.73%) for normal hearing group. Significant high correlation (R = .919, P <= .000) between lexical tone perception and English intonation perception is noted. There is no significant difference for English intonation perception accuracies between Mandarin-speaking cCI (61.82%) and English-speaking cCI (70.13%, P = .11). Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children showed significant deficits in perception of lexical tone and English intonation relative to normal hearing children. There was no tonal language benefit in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children's English intonation perception, compared to the English-speaking cochlear-implanted peers. For cochlear-implanted children, better lexical tone perception comes with better English intonation perception.

The Influence of Tonal and Atonal Bilingualism on Children's Lexical and Non-Lexical Tone Perception,"Morett, LM",2020,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"This study examined how bilingualism in an atonal language, in addition to a tonal language, influences lexical and non-lexical tone perception and word learning during childhood. Forty children aged 5;3-7;2, bilingual either in English and Mandarin or English and another atonal language, were tested on Mandarin lexical tone discrimination, level-pitch sine-wave tone discrimination, and learning of novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone. Mandarin-English bilingual children discriminated between and learned novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone more accurately than their atonal-English bilingual peers. However, Mandarin-English and atonal-English bilingual children discriminated between level-pitch sine-wave tones with similar accuracy. Moreover, atonal-English bilingual children showed a tendency to perceive differing Mandarin lexical and level-pitch sine-wave tones as identical, whereas their Mandarin-English peers showed no such tendency. These results indicate that bilingualism in a tonal language in addition to an atonal language-but not bilingualism in two atonal languages-allows for continued sensitivity to lexical tone beyond infancy. Moreover, they suggest that although tonal-atonal bilingualism does not enhance sensitivity to differences in pitch between sine-wave tones beyond infancy any more effectively than atonal-atonal bilingualism, it protects against the development of biases to perceive differing lexical and non-lexical tones as identical. Together, the results indicate that, beyond infancy, tonal-atonal bilinguals process lexical tones using different cognitive mechanisms than atonal-atonal bilinguals, but that both groups process level-pitch non-lexical tone using the same cognitive mechanisms.",,,10.1177/0023830919834679,WOS:000537760600002,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",the influence of tonal and atonal bilingualism on children s lexical and non lexical tone perception,"Morett, LM",doi:10.1177/0023830919834679,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4
EARLY CORTICAL PROCESSING OF LINGUISTIC PITCH PATTERNS AS REVEALED BY THE MISMATCH NEGATIVITY,"Ren, GQ; Yang, Y; Li, X",2009,NEUROSCIENCE,"Previous brain imaging studies have shown the left hemispheric dominance for processing of lexical tone in native speakers. However, the low temporal resolution related to neuroimaging techniques might not explicitly detect the brain activities that occur at a relatively small or a determined time frame. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and a source estimation technique (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) to probe the brain activities underlying the early pre-attentive processing of Mandarin lexical tone and intonation. A passive oddball paradigm was applied to present tone and intonation contrast in a speech and nonspeech context. The results showed that no difference of the MMN amplitudes existed between speech and nonspeech conditions, although a larger MMN was found for tone than intonation condition. Source localization of the MMNs for all of the conditions showed the right hemispheric dominance, regardless of their linguistic functions (tone vs. intonation) or speech context (speech vs. nonspeech). Interestingly, the MMN generator for normal tone and hummed tone originated from the same cortical area (right parietal lobe, BA 19). These findings suggest that the pre-attentive cortical processing can be modulated not only by speech stimuli, but also by their nonspeech hums. Our data are compatible with the acoustic hypothesis of speech processing. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

Pitch perception and production in congenital amusia: Evidence from Cantonese speakers,"Liu, F; Chan, AHD; Ciocca, V; Roquet, C; Peretz, I; Wong, PCM",2016,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"This study investigated pitch perception and production in speech and music in individuals with congenital amusia (a disorder of musical pitch processing) who are native speakers of Cantonese, a tone language with a highly complex tonal system. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics and 16 controls performed a set of lexical tone perception, production, singing, and psychophysical pitch threshold tasks. Their tone production accuracy and singing proficiency were subsequently judged by independent listeners, and subjected to acoustic analyses. Relative to controls, amusics showed impaired discrimination of lexical tones in both speech and non-speech conditions. They also received lower ratings for singing proficiency, producing larger pitch interval deviations and making more pitch interval errors compared to controls. Demonstrating higher pitch direction identification thresholds than controls for both speech syllables and piano tones, amusics nevertheless produced native lexical tones with comparable pitch trajectories and intelligibility as controls. Significant correlations were found between pitch threshold and lexical tone perception, music perception and production, but not between lexical tone perception and production for amusics. These findings provide further evidence that congenital amusia is a domain-general language-independent pitch-processing deficit that is associated with severely impaired music perception and production, mildly impaired speech perception, and largely intact speech production.

Melodic Pitch Perception and Lexical Tone Perception in Mandarin-Speaking Cochlear Implant Users,"Tao, DD; Deng, R; Jiang, Y; Galvin, JJ; Fu, QJ; Chen, B",2015,EAR AND HEARING,"Objectives: To examine the relationship between lexical tone perception and melodic pitch perception in Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant (CI) users and to investigate the influence of previous acoustic hearing on CI users' speech and music perception. Design: Lexical tone perception and melodic contour identification (MCI) were measured in 21 prelingual and 11 postlingual young (aged 6-26 years) Mandarin-speaking CI users. Lexical tone recognition was measured for four tonal patterns: tone 1 (flat F0), tone 2 (rising F0), tone 3 (falling-rising F0), and tone 4 (falling F0). MCI was measured using nine five-note melodic patterns that contained changes in pitch contour, as well as different semitone spacing between notes. Results: Lexical tone recognition was generally good (overall mean = 81% correct), and there was no significant difference between subject groups. MCI performance was generally poor (mean = 23% correct). MCI performance was significantly better for postlingual (mean = 32% correct) than for prelingual CI participants (mean = 18% correct). After correcting for outliers, there was no significant correlation between lexical tone recognition and MCI performance for prelingual or postlingual CI participants. Age at deafness was significantly correlated with MCI performance only for postlingual participants. CI experience was significantly correlated with MCI performance for both prelingual and postlingual participants. Duration of deafness was significantly correlated with tone recognition only for prelingual participants. Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of pitch cues in Mandarin, the present CI participants had great difficulty perceiving melodic pitch. The availability of amplitude and duration cues in lexical tones most likely compensated for the poor pitch perception observed with these CI listeners. Previous acoustic hearing experience seemed to benefit postlingual CI users' melodic pitch perception. Longer CI experience was associated with better MCI performance for both subject groups, suggesting that CI users' music perception may improve as they gain experience with their device.",,,10.1097/aud.0000000000000086,WOS:000346911200011,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",melodic pitch perception and lexical tone perception in mandarin speaking cochlear implant users,"Tao, DD",doi:10.1097/aud.0000000000000086,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Subgroup differences in the lexical tone mismatch negativity (MMN) among Mandarin speakers with congenital amusia,"Nan, Y; Huang, WT; Wang, WJ; Liu, C; Dong, Q",2016,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY,"The association/dissociation of pitch processing between music and language is a long lasting debate. We examined this music-language relationship by investigating to what extent pitch deficits in these two domains were dissociable. We focused on a special neurodevelopmental pitch disorder congenital amusia, which primarily affects musical pitch processing. Recent research has also revealed lexical tone deficits in speech among amusics. Approximately one-third of Mandarin amusics exhibits behavioural difficulties in lexical tone perception, which is known as tone agnosia. Using mismatch negativities (MMNs), our current work probed lexical tone encoding at the pre-attentive level among the Mandarin amusics with (tone agnosics) and without (pure amusics) behavioural lexical tone deficits compared with age- and IQ-matched controls. Relative to the controls and the pure amusics, the tone agnosics exhibited reduced MMNs specifically in response to lexical tone changes. Their tone-consonant MMNs were intact and similar to those of the other two groups. Moreover, the tone MMN reduction over the left hemisphere was tightly linked to behavioural insensitivity to lexical tone changes. The current study thus provides the first psychophysiological evidence of subgroup differences in lexical tone processing among Mandarin amusics and links amusics' behavioural tone deficits to impaired pre-attentive tone processing. Despite the overall music pitch deficits, the subgroup differences in lexical tone processing in Mandarin-speaking amusics suggest dissociation of pitch deficits between music and speech.

Mandarin-Speaking Amusics' Online Recognition of Tone and Intonation,"Tang, LR; Xu, YXX; Yang, ST; Meng, XY; Du, BQ; Sun, C; Liu, L; Dong, Q; Nan, Y",2024,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing. Its linguistic consequences have been examined separately for speech intonations and lexical tones. However, in a tonal language such as Chinese, the processing of intonations and lexical tones interacts with each other during online speech perception. Whether and how the musical pitch disorder might affect linguistic pitch processing during online speech perception remains unknown. Method: We investigated this question with intonation (question vs. statement) and lexical tone (rising Tone 2 vs. falling Tone 4) identification tasks using the same set of sentences, comparing behavioral and event -related potential measurements between Mandarin -speaking amusics and matched controls. We specifically focused on the amusics without behavioral lexical tone deficits (the majority, i.e., pure amusics). Results: Results showed that, despite relative to normal performance when tested in word lexical tone test, pure amusics demonstrated inferior recognition than controls during sentence tone and intonation identification. Compared to controls, pure amusics had larger N400 amplitudes in question stimuli during tone task and smaller P600 amplitudes in intonation task.

"The interaction of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context in on-line spoken word recognition: An ERP study on Cantonese Chinese","Kung, C; Chwilla, DJ; Schriefers, H",2014,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"In two ERP experiments, we investigate the on-line interplay of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context during spoken word recognition in Cantonese Chinese. Experiment 1 shows that lexical tone and intonation interact immediately. Words with a low lexical tone at the end of questions (with a rising question intonation) lead to a processing conflict. This is reflected in a low accuracy in lexical identification and in a P600 effect compared to the same words at the end of a statement. Experiment 2 shows that a strongly biasing semantic context leads to much better lexical-identification performance for words with a low tone at the end of questions and to a disappearance of the P600 effect. These results support the claim that semantic context plays a major role in disentangling the tonal information from the intonational information, and thus, in resolving the on-line conflict between intonation and tone. However, the ERP data indicate that the introduction of a semantic context does not entirely eliminate on-line processing problems for words at the end of questions. This is revealed by the presence of an N400 effect for words with a low lexical tone and for words with a high-mid lexical tone at the end of questions. The ERP data thus show that, while semantic context helps in the eventual lexical identification, it makes the deviation of the contextually expected lexical tone from the actual acoustic signal more salient.

Among Mandarin speakers, some amusics also have difficulties in processing lexical tones (tone agnosics). To examine to what extent these perceptual deficits may be related to pitch production impairments in music and Mandarin speech, eight amusics, eight tone agnosics, and 12 age- and IQ-matched normal native Mandarin speakers were asked to imitate music note sequences and Mandarin words of comparable lengths. The results indicated that both the amusics and tone agnosics underperformed the controls on musical pitch production. However, tone agnosics performed no worse than the amusics, suggesting that lexical tone perception deficits may not aggravate musical pitch production difficulties. Moreover, these three groups were all able to imitate lexical tones with perfect intelligibility. Taken together, the current study shows that perceptual musical pitch and lexical tone deficits might coexist with musical pitch production difficulties. But at the same time these perceptual pitch deficits might not affect lexical tone production or the intelligibility of the speech words that were produced.

The Perception of Lexical Tone and Intonation in Whispered Speech by Mandarin-Speaking Congenital Amusics,"Zhang, GY; Shao, J; Zhang, CC; Wang, L",2022,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: A fundamental feature of human speech is variation, including the manner of phonation, as exemplified in the case of whispered speech. In this study, we employed whispered speech to examine an unresolved issue about congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical pitch processing, which also affects speech pitch processing such as lexical tone and intonation perception. The controversy concerns whether amusia is a pitch-processing disorder or can affect speech processing beyond pitch. Method: We examined lexical tone and intonation recognition in 19 Mandarin-speaking amusics and 19 matched controls in phonated and whispered speech, where fundamental frequency (f(o)) information is either present or absent. Results: The results revealed that the performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls in lexical tone identification in both phonated and whispered speech. These impairments were also detected in identifying intonation (statements/questions) in phonated and whispered modes. Across the experiments, regression models revealed that f(o) and non-f(o) (duration, intensity, and formant frequency) acoustic cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in phonated speech, whereas non-f(o) cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in whispered speech. There were significant differences between amusics and controls in the use of both f(o) and non-f(o) cues.

Infants' Perception of Intonation: Is It a Statement or a Question?,"Frota, S; Butler, J; Vigário, M",2014,INFANCY,"The ability to distinguish phonetic variations in speech that are relevant to meaning is essential for infants' language development.

Using a modified version of the visual habituation paradigm, EP-learning infants at 5-6 and 8-9months were able to successfully discriminate segmentally varied, single-prosodic word intonational phrases presented with statement or yes-no question intonation, demonstrating that they are sensitive to the prosodic cues marking this distinction as early as 5months and maintain this sensitivity throughout the first year.

Protracted Development on Native Tone Interpretation: Evidence From Mandarin-Learning Infants' Novel Word Learning,"Zheng, XB; Ji, YL; Meng, XZ",2019,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Studies have shown that infants from cultures with tone languages develop categorical perception of their native lexical tone before their first birthday, but few studies have explored whether, and when, they interpret the phonemic function of lexical tone in word learning. Two habituation-switch experiments were conducted to explore whether Mandarin-learning infants could exploit tonal cues during their word learning, and detect a change when the association of two word-object pairs was switched. In Experiment 1, two words were solely differentiated by their lexical tones (fai/ vs. /fai/), and Mandarin-learning infants failed to detect the switch of tones at 14 months, but succeeded at 18 months. In Experiment 2, two words were markedly distinct (/fai/ vs. /bou/), and infants could detect the change of words as early as 14 months. The results indicate that infants may not refer to the lexical function of tone during their novel word learning until 18 months, even though infants from birth are able to distinguish the Tone 1 vs. Tone 3 contrast. Given that lexical tone is expressed by variations of the pitch contours, which are also related to intonation, infants' increasing knowledge of both tone and intonation may contribute to their misinterpretation of pitch contours in word learning at 14 months and, further, to their development of a sophisticated use of the phonemic function of lexical tone at 18 months of age.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01512,WOS:000474204400001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",protracted development on native tone interpretation evidence from mandarin learning infants novel word learning,"Zheng, XB",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01512,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Effects of production training and perception training on lexical tone perception - A behavioral and ERP study,"Lu, S; Wayland, R; Kaan, E",2015,BRAIN RESEARCH,"The present study recorded both behavioral data and event-related brain potentials to examine the effectiveness of a perception-only training and a perception-plus-production training procedure on the intentional and unintentional perception of lexical tone by native English listeners. In the behavioral task, both the perception-only and the perception-plus-production groups improved on the tone discrimination abilities after the training session. Moreover, the participants in both groups generalized the improvements gained through the trained stimuli to the untrained stimuli. In the ERP task, the Mismatch Negativity was smaller in the post-training task than in the pre-training task. However, the two training groups did not differ in tone processing at the intentional or unintentional level after training. These results suggest that the employment of the motor system does not specifically benefit the tone perceptual skills. Furthermore, the present study investigated whether some tone pairs are more easily confused than others by native English listeners, and whether the order of tone presentation influences non-native tone discrimination. In the behavioral task, Tone2-Tone1 (rising-level) and Tone2-Tone4 (rising-falling) were the most difficult tone pairs, while Tone1-Tone2 and Tone4-Tone2 were the easiest tone pairs, even though they involved the same tone contrasts respectively. In the ERP task, the native English listeners had good discrimination when Tone2 and Tone4 were embedded in strings of Tone1, while poor discrimination when Tone1 was inserted in the context of Tone2 or Tone4. These asymmetries in tone perception might be attributed to the interference of native intonation system and can be altered by training. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Just noticeable difference of tone pitch contour change for English- and Chinese-native listeners,"Liu, C",2013,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Just noticeable differences of tone pitch contour discrimination were examined for young English- and Mandarin Chinese-native listeners to examine categorical features of tone perception for the two groups of listeners. Three types of stimuli were used: A Mandarin Chinese vowel, an English vowel, and tonal glides. Level, rising, and falling tones within or across tone boundaries served as the standard stimuli to measure thresholds of tone pitch discrimination. Performance was equivalent between English-and Chinese-native listeners for level tones, but significantly differed for rising and falling tones, regardless of the type of stimuli. English listeners showed significantly lower thresholds at the offset of F0 shifts than Chinese listeners, while Chinese listeners discriminated tone pitch changes at the onset with significantly lower thresholds than their English peers. These psychophysical results, combined with tone perception reported in other studies, indicated that Mandarin-native listeners perceived lexical tones in a categorical manner, based on their lexical tone experience, whereas English-native listeners perceived tones on a psychophysical base.

Perception of intonation in Mandarin Chinese,"Yuan, JH",2011,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"There is a tendency across languages to use a rising pitch contour to convey question intonation and a falling pitch contour to convey a statement. In a lexical tone language such as Mandarin Chinese, rising and falling pitch contours are also used to differentiate lexical meaning. How, then, does the multiplexing of the F-0 channel affect the perception of question and statement intonation in a lexical tone language? This study investigated the effects of lexical tones and focus on the perception of intonation in Mandarin Chinese. The results show that lexical tones and focus impact the perception of sentence intonation. Question intonation was easier for native speakers to identify on a sentence with a final falling tone and more difficult to identify on a sentence with a final rising tone, suggesting that tone identification intervenes in the mapping of F-0 contours to intonational categories and that tone and intonation interact at the phonological level. In contrast, there is no evidence that the interaction between focus and intonation goes beyond the psychoacoustic level. The results provide insights that will be useful for further research on tone and intonation interactions in both acoustic modeling studies and neurobiological studies.

Context Matters for Tone and Intonation Processing in Mandarin,"Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO",2022,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"In tonal languages such as Mandarin, both lexical tone and sentence intonation are primarily signaled by F0. Their F0 encodings are sometimes in conflict and sometimes in congruency. The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that top-down information provided by the semantically constraining context can play a facilitating role for listeners to disentangle intonational information from tonal information, but mainly in sentences with the lexical falling tone in the final position.",,,10.1177/0023830920986174,WOS:000618452600001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",context matters for tone and intonation processing in mandarin,"Liu, M",doi:10.1177/0023830920986174,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4

Thirty (14 male) children were identified as having dyslexia, and the remaining children (N = 142; 67 male) were typically developing children matched with those with dyslexia as carefully as possible with respect to school, grade, and gender. Our results indicated that group differences were found for all three types of prosodic sensitivity. Moderation analyses showed that group had no significant interaction with prosodic sensitivity in predicting Chinese reading, so the participants in the two groups were combined in the following analyses. The results of the stepwise regression analyses showed that only lexical tone awareness could significantly predict Chinese character reading after controlling for phonological awareness, while only intonation awareness could significantly predict reading comprehension after controlling for Chinese character reading.

Categorical perception of lexical tone contrasts and gradient perception of the statement-question intonation contrast in Zhumadian Mandarin,"Gussenhoven, C; van de Ven, M",2020,LANGUAGE AND COGNITION,"We intended to establish if two lexical tone contrasts in Zhumadian Mandarin, one between early and late aligned falls and another between early and late aligned rises, are perceived categorically, while the difference between declarative and interrogative pronunciations of these four tones is perceived gradiently. Presenting stimuli from 7-point acoustic continua between tones and between intonations, we used an identification task and a discrimination task with an experimental group of native listeners and a control group of Indonesian listeners, whose language employs none of the differences within either the falling or the rising pitch contours in its phonology. Only the lexical condition as perceived by the experimental group yielded sigmoid identification functions and a heightened discriminatory sensitivity around the midpoint of continua. The intonational condition in the native group and both conditions in the control group yielded gradient identification functions and smaller, reverse effects of the continuum midpoints in the discrimination task. The results are interpreted to mean that sentence modality contrasts can be expressed gradiently, but that lexical tone differences are represented phonologically, and hence are perceived categorically, despite low phonetic salience of the contrast.

Rise and fall: Effects of tone and intonation on spoken word recognition in early childhood,"Singh, L; Chee, M",2016,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"A crucial component of word learning is the ability to recognize words in spite of the varying forms they assume. This may be particularly challenging in tone languages as learners have to develop tone representations in the face of intonational variation in order to accurately recognize words. The effects of intonational variation on word recognition of tone-marked words in Mandarin Chinese were investigated in toddlers and preschoolers using a cross-sectional design. Participants were presented with known words where intonation (question/statement) and tone (rising/falling) were independently manipulated. Results demonstrated that word recognition in toddlers was heavily influenced by changes in the pitch contour of a tone due to intonational variation. In contrast, preschool were able to recognize tone-marked words regardless of simultaneous intonational variation, demonstrating a comparatively robust representation of lexical tone. Results chart an evolution in integrating pitch cues to tone and intonation over the first few years of life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The perception of intonation questions and statements in Cantonese,"Ma, JKY; Ciocca, V; Whitehill, TL",2011,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"In tone languages there are potential conflicts in the perception of lexical tone and intonation, as both depend mainly on the differences in fundamental frequency (F0) patterns. The present study investigated the acoustic cues associated with the perception of sentences as questions or statements in Cantonese, as a function of the lexical tone in sentence final position. Cantonese listeners performed intonation identification tasks involving complete sentences, isolated final syllables, and sentences without the final syllable (carriers). Sensitivity (d' scores) were similar for complete sentences and final syllables but were significantly lower for carriers. Sensitivity was also affected by tone identity. These findings show that the perception of questions and statements relies primarily on the F0 characteristics of the final syllables (local F0 cues). A measure of response bias (c) provided evidence for a general bias toward the perception of statements. Logistic regression analyses showed that utterances were accurately classified as questions or statements by using average F0 and F0 interval. Average F0 of carriers (global F0 cue) was also found to be a reliable secondary cue. These findings suggest that the use of F0 cues for the perception of intonation question in tonal languages is likely to be language-specific. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

The Effects of Lexical Pitch Accent on Infant Word Recognition in Japanese,"Ota, M; Yamane, N; Mazuka, R",2018,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Learners of lexical tone languages (e.g., Mandarin) develop sensitivity to tonal contrasts and recognize pitch-matched, but not pitch-mismatched, familiar words by 11 months. Learners of non-tone languages (e.g., English) also show a tendency to treat pitch patterns as lexically contrastive up to about 18 months. In this study, we examined if this early-developing capacity to lexically encode pitch variations enables infants to acquire a pitch accent system, in which pitch-based lexical contrasts are obscured by the interaction of lexical and non-lexical (i.e., intonational) features. Eighteen 17-month-olds learning Tokyo Japanese were tested on their recognition of familiar words with the expected pitch or the lexically opposite pitch pattern. In early trials, infants were faster in shifting their eyegaze from the distractor object to the target object than in shifting from the target to distractor in the pitch-matched condition. In later trials, however, infants showed faster distractor-to-target than target-to-distractor shifts in both the pitch-matched and pitch-mismatched conditions.

Lexical function of pitch in the first language shapes cross-linguistic perception of Thai tones,"Schaefer, V; Darcy, I",2014,LABORATORY PHONOLOGY,"Determining the factors involved in the non-native perception of the pitch patterns of tones is complicated by the fact that all languages use pitch to various extents, whether linguistic (e.g., intonation) or non-linguistic (e.g., singing). Moreover, many languages use pitch to distinguish lexical items with varying degrees of functional load and differences in inventory of such pitch patterns. The current study attempts to understand what factors determine accurate naive (= non-learner) perception of non-native tones, in order to establish the baseline for acquisition of a tonal L2. We examine the perception of Thai tones (i.e., three level tones, two contour tones) by speakers of languages on a spectrum of lexically contrastive pitch usage: Mandarin (lexical tone), Japanese (lexical pitch accent), English (lexical stress), and Korean (no lexically contrastive pitch). Results suggest that the importance of lexically contrastive pitch in the L1 influences non-native tone perception so that not all non-tonal language speakers possess the same level of tonal sensitivity, resulting in a hierarchy of perceptual accuracy. Referencing the Feature Hypothesis (McAllister et al. 2002), we propose the Functional Pitch Hypothesis to model our findings: the degree to which linguistic pitch differentiates lexical items in the L1 shapes the naive perception of a non-native lexically contrastive pitch system, e.g., tones.",,,10.1515/lp-2014-0016,WOS:000365703800003,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",lexical function of pitch in the first language shapes cross linguistic perception of thai tones,"Schaefer, V",doi:10.1515/lp-2014-0016,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
"Cross-domain correlation in pitch perception, the influence of native language","Chen, A; Liu, LQ; Kager, R",2016,LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE,"The current study explores how language experience may shape the correlation between lexical tone and musical pitch perception. A two domains (music and lexical tone) by two languages (tone, Mandarin Chinese and non-tone, Dutch) design is adopted. Participants were tested on their discrimination of Mandarin Chinese lexical tones, Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), and Musical Ear Test (MET). The Chinese listeners outperformed the Dutch listeners on both MBEA and MET, but had comparable accuracies for the lexical tone discrimination. Importantly, a significant cross-domain correlation was only observed for the Dutch listeners but not for the Chinese listeners. For tone language listeners, once lexical tones have been acquired, native listeners perceive them as phonological categories, and split them from other pitch variations that do not play a phonemic role. Non-tone language listeners, on the other hand, perceive both lexical tones and musical pitch on a psycho-acoustical basis, hence exhibit a unified perception of pitch across the two domains.",,,10.1080/23273798.2016.1156715,WOS:000377776900004,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",cross domain correlation in pitch perception the influence of native language,"Chen, A",doi:10.1080/23273798.2016.1156715,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Perception of Intonation on Neutral Tone in Mandarin,"Zhang, YX; Schmidt, E; Post, B",2022,FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION,"In Mandarin, lexical tone has been found to interact with intonational tone to influence intonation perception, with the falling T4 facilitating the perception of the statement/question contrast the most, and the rising T2 the least. However, in addition to the four citation tones T1-T4, Mandarin has ""neutral tone"" which marks weak, non-initial syllables that do not carry a citation tone. The prevailing view is that neutral tone is, in fact, phonologically toneless. It is unknown whether neutral tone can also affect intonation perception. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that if neutral tone is indeed toneless, it cannot interact with intonational tone in the same way as citation tones do. We investigated this novel hypothesis with a perception experiment in which 22 Mandarin speakers had to determine whether disyllabic citation tone and neutral tone words were a question or statement. Results show that the identification of intonation contours is more accurate for neutral tone than for T2, and similarly accurate for neutral tone and T4, regardless of whether the neutral tone is intrinsic or derived. Furthermore, both T4 and neutral tone are realized with a reduced pitch range at a higher pitch level in questions, unlike T2, which is characterized by a slightly expanded pitch range and a higher pitch level. It is possible that intonation perception in Mandarin is facilitated by changes in the phonetic shapes of lexical tones brought by intonation rather than the phonological interaction between lexical tones and intonation. The importance of pitch changes to the intonation perception in Mandarin was further tested in a second perception experiment with the same 22 participants and disyllabic stimuli with manipulated pitch level and range. Results indicate that the use of pitch cues in intonation perception shows tone-specific differences, namely, pitch range is more important in signaling the question/statement contrast in utterances ending with T4 or neutral tone, while pitch level is the only perceptual cue to interrogativity for utterances ending in T2.",,,10.3389/fcomm.2022.849132,WOS:000822933300001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",perception of intonation on neutral tone in mandarin,"Zhang, YX",doi:10.3389/fcomm.2022.849132,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin: Evidence from ERPs,"Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO",2016,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin at the attentive stage.

A clear P300 effect was observed for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone4, but no ERP effect was found for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone2. Our results provide ERP evidence for the interaction of tone and intonation in Mandarin, confirming the findings with behavioral metalinguistic data that native Mandarin listeners can distinguish between question intonation and statement intonation when the intonation is associated with a final Tone4, but fail to do so when the intonation is associated with a final Tone2.

Vowel and tone recognition in quiet and in noise among Mandarin-speaking amusics,"Tang, W; Wang, XJ; Li, JQ; Liu, C; Dong, Q; Nan, Y",2018,HEARING RESEARCH,"Music and language are two intricately linked communication modalities in humans. A deficit in music pitch processing as manifested in the condition of congenital amusia has been related to difficulties in lexical tone processing for both tone and non-tonal languages. However, it is still unclear whether amusia also affects the perception of vowel phonemes in quiet and in noise. In this study, we examined vowel-plustone identification in quiet and noise conditions among Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without speech tone difficulties (tone agnosics and pure amusics, respectively), and IQ- and age-matched controls. Overall, pure amusics showed vowel and tone identification comparable to the controls in both quiet and noise conditions. Compared to pure amusics and controls, tone agnosics showed deficits in tone perception in both quiet and noise conditions. More importantly, their vowel perception was lower than pure amusics and controls in noise conditions, e.g., at a signal-to-noise ratio of -4 dB, although they showed normal-like performance in quiet and at a signal-to-noise ratio of -8 dB. These results suggest that when amusia affected speech tone processing (e.g., tone agnosics), it could also compromise vowel processing in noise. However, amusia alone does not affect tone or vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese either in quiet or in noise. Overall, the current study highlights the necessity of taking heterogeneity within the amusic group into account when considering the related speech deficits in this group. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

CATEGORIZING MANDARIN TONES INTO LISTENERS' NATIVE PROSODIC CATEGORIES: THE ROLE OF PHONETIC PROPERTIES,"So, CK; Best, CT",2011,POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS,"This study examined whether native speakers of non-tone languages (Australian English, and French) were able to perceive foreign Mandarin tones in a sentence environment according to their native prosodic categories. Results found that both English and French speakers were able to perceptually categorize foreign tones into their intonational categories (i-Categories), and that categorizations were based on the contextual phonetic similarities of the pitch contours they perceived between Mandarin tones and their native i-Categories. Results also showed that French speakers, but not English speakers, were able to detect the fine-detailed phonetic feature differences between Tone 3 and Tone 4 (low/falling tone vs. high-falling tone). The findings support a new extension of the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM; Best 1995) to suprasegmental phonology (So and Best 2008): that non-native prosodic categories (e. g. lexical tones) will be assimilated to the categories of listeners' native prosodic system (e. g. intonation).

Intonation processing increases task-specific fronto-temporal connectivity in tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2021,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Language comprehension depends on tight functional interactions between distributed brain regions. While these interactions are established for semantic and syntactic processes, the functional network of speech intonation - the linguistic variation of pitch - has been scarcely defined. Particularly little is known about intonation in tonal languages, in which pitch not only serves intonation but also expresses meaning via lexical tones. The present study used psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterise the neural networks underlying intonation and tone processing in native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Participants categorised either intonation or tone of monosyllabic Mandarin words that gradually varied between statement and question and between Tone 2 and Tone 4. Intonation processing induced bilateral fronto-temporal activity and increased functional connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal regions, likely linking auditory perception and labelling of intonation categories in a phonological network. Tone processing induced bilateral temporal activity, associated with the auditory representation of tonal (phonemic) categories. Together, the present data demonstrate the breadth of the functional intonation network in a tonal language including higher-level phonological processes in addition to auditory representations common to both intonation and tone.",,,10.1002/hbm.25214,WOS:000573645300001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",intonation processing increases task specific fronto temporal connectivity in tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ",doi:10.1002/hbm.25214,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4
Constraints on Tone Sensitivity in Novel Word Learning by Monolingual and Bilingual Infants: Tone Properties Are More Influential than Tone Familiarity,"Burnham, D; Singh, L; Mattock, K; Woo, PJ; Kalashnikova, M",2018,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This study compared tone sensitivity in monolingual and bilingual infants in a novel word learning task. Tone language learning infants (Experiment 1, Mandarin monolingual; Experiment 2, Mandarin-English bilingual) were tested with Mandarin (native) or Thai (non-native) lexical tone pairs which contrasted static vs. dynamic (high vs. rising) tones or dynamic vs. dynamic (rising vs. falling) tones. Non-tone language, English-learning infants (Experiment 3) were tested on English intonational contrasts or the Mandarin or Thai tone contrasts. Monolingual Mandarin language infants were able to bind tones to novel words for the Mandarin High-Rising contrast, but not for the Mandarin Rising-Falling contrast; and they were insensitive to both the High-Rising and the Rising-Falling tone contrasts in Thai. Bilingual English-Mandarin infants were similar to the Mandarin monolinguals in that they were sensitive to the Mandarin High-Rising contrast and not to the Mandarin Rising-Falling contrast. However, unlike the Mandarin monolinguals, they were also sensitive to the High Rising contrast in Thai. Monolingual English learning infants were insensitive to all three types of contrasts (Mandarin, Thai, English), although they did respond differentially to tone-bearing vs. intonation-marked words. Findings suggest that infants' sensitivity to tones in word learning contexts depends heavily on tone properties, and that this influence is, in some cases, stronger than effects of language familiarity.

Processing of Acoustic Cues in Lexical-Tone Identification by Pediatric Cochlear-Implant Recipients,"Peng, SC; Lu, HP; Lu, N; Lin, YS; Deroche, MLD; Chatterjee, M",2017,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: The objective was to investigate acoustic cue processing in lexical-tone recognition by pediatric cochlear-implant (CI) recipients who are native Mandarin speakers. Method: Lexical-tone recognition was assessed in pediatric CI recipients and listeners with normal hearing (NH) in 2 tasks. In Task 1, participants identified naturally uttered words that were contrastive in lexical tones. For Task 2, a disyllabic word (yanjing) was manipulated orthogonally, varying in fundamental-frequency (F0) contours and duration patterns. Participants identified each token with the second syllable jing pronounced with Tone 1 (a high level tone) as eyes or with Tone 4 (a high falling tone) as eyeglasses. Results: CI participants' recognition accuracy was significantly lower than NH listeners' in Task 1. In Task 2, CI participants' reliance on F0 contours was significantly less than that of NH listeners; their reliance on duration patterns, however, was significantly higher than that of NH listeners. Both CI and NH listeners' performance in Task 1 was significantly correlated with their reliance on F0 contours in Task 2.

Just-Noticeable Differences of Fundamental Frequency Change in Mandarin-Speaking Children with Cochlear Implants,"Huang, WT; Wong, LLN; Chen, F",2022,BRAIN SCIENCES,"Fundamental frequency (F0) provides the primary acoustic cue for lexical tone perception in tonal languages but remains poorly represented in cochlear implant (CI) systems. Currently, there is still a lack of understanding of sensitivity to F0 change in CI users who speak tonal languages. In the present study, just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of F0 contour and F0 level changes in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs were measured and compared with those in their age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Results showed that children with CIs demonstrated significantly larger JND of F0 contour (JND-C) change and F0 level (JND-L) change compared to NH children. Further within-group comparison revealed that the JND-C change was significantly smaller than the JND-L change among children with CIs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among NH children. No significant correlations were seen between JND-C change/JND-L change and age at implantation /duration of CI use.

While the samples' heterogeneous cognitive abilities may be contributing factors, the phenotype of tone and intonation processing in autism may also vary with one's language background. Thirty-eight cognitively able autistic and 32 non-autistic Mandarin-speaking children completed tone and intonation perception tasks, each containing a function and form condition. Results suggested that the abilities to discriminate tone and intonation were not impaired at either the form or function level in these autistic children, and that these abilities were positively associated with one another in both autistic and non-autistic groups. The more severe the autism symptoms, the worse the form- and function-level of tone and intonation processing. While enhanced tone and intonation processing has been found in a subgroup of autistic children, it may not be a general characteristic of the autistic population with long-term tone language experience.

Towards an International Prosodic Alphabet (IPrA),"Hualde, JI; Prieto, P",2016,LABORATORY PHONOLOGY,"In this article we present a set of arguments in favor of having access to two levels of prosodic representation, broad phonetic and phonological, and the motivations for developing a set of cross-linguistically transparent and consistent labels (e. g., an International Prosodic Alphabet, IPrA) based on the Autosegmental-Metrical (AM) framework and the ToBI notation. Regarding segmental phonology, as well as lexical suprasegmentals (lexical tone and stress), both the use of two levels of representation and the existence of an international phonetic alphabet have proved to be very useful.

Vowel and Tone Identification for Mandarin Congenital Amusics: Effects of Vowel Type and Semantic Content,"Li, MS; Tang, W; Liu, C; Nan, Y; Wang, WJ; Dong, Q",2019,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the effects of Mandarin congenital amusia with or without lexical tone deficit (i.e., tone agnosia and pure amusia) on Mandarin vowel and tone identification in different types of vowels (e.g., monophthong, diphthongs, and triphthongs) embedded in consonant-vowel contexts with and without semantic content. Method: Thirteen pure amusics (i.e., amusics with normal lexical processing), 5 tone agnosics (i.e., with lexical tone deficit), and 12 controls were screened with Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia and lexical tone tests (Nan et al., 2010; Peretz et al., 2003). Vowel-plus-tone identification tasks with the factors of vowel type and syllables with and without semantic content (e.g., real and nonsense words) were examined among the 3 groups, and identification scores were calculated in 3 formats: vowel-plus-tone identification, vowel identification, and tone identification. Results: Tone agnosics showed significantly poorer performances on identifications of vowel, tone, and vowel plus tone across monophthongs, diphthongs, and triphthongs in both real and nonsense words compared to pure amusics and controls. Their deficits were similar across the 3 types of vowels, while the deficit on vowel-plus-tone identification was more severe in nonsense words than in real words. On the other hand, pure amusics performed similarly with controls across all these conditions. Conclusions: Tone agnosia might affect both musical pitch and phonological processing, resulting in deficits in lexical tone and vowel perception. On the contrary, pure amusics's effect is primarily on musical pitch perception but not on lexical tone or phonemic deficit. Vowel type did not affect speech deficits for tone agnosics, while they relied more on semantic content as a compensation.",,,10.1044/2019_jslhr-s-18-0440,WOS:000561769300006,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",vowel and tone identification for mandarin congenital amusics effects of vowel type and semantic content,"Li, MS",doi:10.1044/2019_jslhr-s-18-0440,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Processing of Acoustic Information in Lexical Tone Production and Perception by Pediatric Cochlear Implant Recipients,"Deroche, MLD; Lu, HP; Lin, YS; Chatterjee, M; Peng, SC",2019,FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE,"Purpose: This study examined the utilization of multiple types of acoustic information in lexical tone production and perception by pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients who are native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Methods: Lexical tones were recorded from CI recipients and their peers with normal hearing (NH). Each participant was asked to produce a disyllabic word, yan jing, with which the first syllable was pronounced as Tone 3 (a low dipping tone) while the second syllable was pronounced as Tone 1 (a high level tone, meaning ""eyes"") or as Tone 4 (a high falling tone, meaning ""eyeglasses""). In addition, a parametric manipulation in fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of Tones 1 and 4 used in a lexical tone recognition task in Peng et al. (2017) was adopted to evaluate the perceptual reliance on each dimension. Results: Mixed-effect analyses of duration, intensity, and F0 cues revealed that NH children focused exclusively on marking distinct F0 contours, while CI participants shortened Tone 4 or prolonged Tone 1 to enhance their contrast. In line with these production strategies, NH children relied primarily on F0 cues to identify the two tones, whereas CI children showed greater reliance on duration cues. Moreover, CI participants who placed greater perceptual weight on duration cues also tended to exhibit smaller changes in their F0 production. Conclusion: Pediatric CI recipients appear to contrast the secondary acoustic dimension (duration) in addition to F0 contours for both lexical tone production and perception.

"Developmental change in tone perception in Mandarin monolingual, English monolingual, and Mandarin-English bilingual infants: Divergences between monolingual and bilingual learners","Singh, L; Fu, CSL; Seet, XH; Tong, APY; Wang, JL; Best, CT",2018,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,"Most languages use lexical tone to discriminate the meanings of words. There has been recent interest in tracking the development of tone categories during infancy. These studies have focused largely on monolingual infants learning either a tone language or a non-tone language. It remains to be seen how bilingual infants learning one tone language (e.g., Mandarin) and one non-tone language (e.g., English) discriminate tones. Here, we examined infants' discrimination of two Mandarin tones pairs: one salient and one subtle. Discrimination was investigated in three groups: Mandarin-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and Mandarin monolinguals at 6 months and 9 months of age in a cross-sectional design. Results demonstrated relatively strong Mandarin tone discrimination in Mandarin monolinguals, with salient tone discrimination at 6 months and both salient and subtle tone discrimination at 9 months. English monolinguals discriminated neither contrast at 6 months but discriminated the salient contrast at 9 months. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for tone discrimination in Mandarin-English bilingual infants. In a second experiment, 12- and 13-month-old Mandarin-English bilingual and English monolingual infants were tested to determine whether bilinguals would demonstrate tone sensitivity at a later age. Results revealed a lack of tone sensitivity at 12 or 13 months in bilingual infants, yet English monolingual infants were sensitive to both salient and subtle Mandarin tone contrasts at 12 or 13 months. Our findings provide evidence for age-related convergence in Mandarin tone discrimination in English and Mandarin monolingual infants and for a distinct pattern of tone discrimination in bilingual infants. Theoretical implications for phonetic category acquisition are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The phonology of tone and intonation in the Dutch dialect of Venlo,"Gussenhoven, C; Van der Vliet, P",1999,JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS,"The Dutch dialect of Venlo has a lexical tone opposition comparable to the distinction between Accent I and Accent II in Scandinavian. The two word tone patterns are realised in a variety of different ways, depending on the intonation contour, on whether the word has a focus tone, and on whether it occurs finally or nonfinally in the intonational phrase (IP). Twelve such contexts are identified, and an autosegmental-metrical analysis is presented of the contours for the word tones in each of these. The analysis is instructive because of its clear illustration of the distinction between the phonological underlying representation and the phonological surface representation, as well as of the distinction between the latter representation and the phonetic realisation. In addition, because of the complexity of its tonal phonology, the dialect is of considerable typological interest for the study of word prosody and intonation.",,,10.1017/s0022226798007324,WOS:000080648200004,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",the phonology of tone and intonation in the dutch dialect of venlo,"Gussenhoven, C",doi:10.1017/s0022226798007324,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2

Method: Speech materials with a question-statement contrast were collected from 14 Cantonese speakers with PD. Twenty listeners then classified the productions as either questions or statements. Acoustic analyses of F0, duration, and intensity were conducted to determine which acoustic cues distinguished the production of questions from statements, and which cues appeared to be exploited by listeners in identifying intonational contrasts. Results: The results show that listeners identified statements with a high degree of accuracy, but the accuracy of question identification ranged from 0.56% to 96% across the 14 speakers. The speakers with PD used similar acoustic cues as nondysarthric Cantonese speakers to mark the question-statement contrast, although the contrasts were not observed in all speakers.

Neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non-tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D",2020,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Intonation, the modulation of pitch in speech, is a crucial aspect of language that is processed in right-hemispheric regions, beyond the classical left-hemispheric language system. Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.",,,10.1002/hbm.24916,WOS:000508026600001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non tonal language speakers,"Chien, PJ",doi:10.1002/hbm.24916,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND prosody) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",5
"How Tone, Intonation and Emotion Shape the Development of Infants' Fundamental Frequency Perception","Liu, LQ; Goetz, A; Lorette, P; Tyler, MD",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Fundamental frequency (integral(0)), perceived as pitch, is the first and arguably most salient auditory component humans are exposed to since the beginning of life. It carries multiple linguistic (e.g., word meaning) and paralinguistic (e.g., speakers' emotion) functions in speech and communication. The mappings between these functions and integral(0) features vary within a language and differ cross-linguistically. For instance, a rising pitch can be perceived as a question in English but a lexical tone in Mandarin. Such variations mean that infants must learn the specific mappings based on their respective linguistic and social environments. To date, canonical theoretical frameworks and most empirical studies do not view or consider the multi-functionality of integral(0), but typically focus on individual functions. More importantly, despite the eventual mastery of integral(0) in communication, it is unclear how infants learn to decompose and recognize these overlapping functions carried by integral(0). In this paper, we review the symbioses and synergies of the lexical, intonational, and emotional functions that can be carried by integral(0) and are being acquired throughout infancy. On the basis of our review, we put forward the Learnability Hypothesis that infants decompose and acquire multiple integral(0) functions through native/environmental experiences. Under this hypothesis, we propose representative cases such as the synergy scenario, where infants use visual cues to disambiguate and decompose the different integral(0) functions. Further, viable ways to test the scenarios derived from this hypothesis are suggested across auditory and visual modalities. Discovering how infants learn to master the diverse functions carried by integral(0) can increase our understanding of linguistic systems, auditory processing and communication functions.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906848,WOS:000812838400001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",how tone intonation and emotion shape the development of infants fundamental frequency perception,"Liu, LQ",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906848,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Mapping non-native pitch contours to meaning: Perceptual and experiential factors,"Hay, JF; Cannistraci, RA; Zhao, Q",2019,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Infants show interesting patterns of flexibility and constraint early in word learning. Here, we explore perceptual and experiential factors that drive associative learning of labels that differ in pitch contour. Contrary to the salience hypothesis proposed in Experiment 1, English-learning 14-month-olds failed to map acoustically distinctive level and dipping labels to novel referents, even though they discriminated the labels when no potential referents were present. Conversely, infants readily mapped the less distinctive rising and dipping labels. In Experiment 2, we found that the degree of pitch variation in labels also does not account for learning. Instead, English-learning infants only learned if one of the labels had a rising pitch contour. We argue that experience with hearing and/or producing native language prosody may lead infants to initially over-interpret the role rising pitch plays in differentiating words. Together, our findings suggest that multiple factors contribute to whether specific acoustic forms will function as candidate object labels.",,,10.1016/j.jml.2018.12.004,WOS:000459523200009,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",mapping non native pitch contours to meaning perceptual and experiential factors,"Hay, JF",doi:10.1016/j.jml.2018.12.004,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Reduced Context Effect on Lexical Tone Normalization in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Speech-Specific Mechanism,"Kuang, C; Chen, F; Yan, JT; Peng, G",2025,JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS,"Existing literature has demonstrated that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical use of contextual information in their surroundings. However, there is limited understanding regarding their integration of contextual cues in speech processing. This study aims to explore how Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD identify lexical tones in speech and nonspeech contexts, and to determine whether the size of context effect would be modulated by children's cognitive abilities. Twenty-five children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) children were asked to identify Mandarin lexical tones preceded by three types of contexts (speech, nonspeech, and nonspeech-flattened contexts). We also tested child participants' verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory capacity. Results revealed that the context effect was only observed in the speech contexts, where Mandarin-speaking children with ASD exhibited a reduced context effect compared to TD children. Moreover, TD children with higher verbal intelligence demonstrated a diminished context effect. However, nonverbal intelligence and working memory capacity were not significantly associated with the size of context effect in either group.

Auditory-Motor Mapping Training Facilitates Speech and Word Learning in Tone Language-Speaking Children With Autism: An Early Efficacy Study,"Yan, JT; Chen, F; Gao, XT; Peng, G",2021,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: It has been reported that tone language-speaking children with autism demonstrate speech-specific lexical tone processing difficulty, although they have intact or even better-than-normal processing of nonspeech/melodic pitch analogues. In this early efficacy study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) in facilitating speech and word output for Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism, in comparison with a matched non-AMMT-based control treatment. Method: Fifteen Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism spectrum disorder participated and completed all the AMMT-based treatment sessions by intoning (singing) and tapping the target words delivered via an app, whereas another 15 participants received control treatment. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to evaluate speech production accuracy and word production intelligibility across different groups and conditions. Results: Results showed that the AMMT-based treatment provided a more effective training approach in accelerating the rate of speech (especially lexical tone) and word learning in the trained items. More importantly, the enhanced training efficacy on lexical tone acquisition remained at 2 weeks after therapy and generalized to untrained tones that were not practiced. Furthermore, the low-verbal participants showed higher improvement compared to the nonverbal participants. Conclusions: These data provide the first empirical evidence for adopting the AMMT-based training to facilitate speech and word learning in Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism. This early efficacy study holds promise for improving lexical tone production in Mandarin-speaking children with autism but should be further replicated in larger scale randomized studies.

ACOUSTIC PATTERNS IN HONG KONG CANTONESE HESITATION MARKERS: VOWEL QUALITY AND OMNISYLLABIC TONE,"Sevilla, RM",2024,JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS,"Hesitation markers (HMs) lie somewhere on the dividing line between linguistic and sub-linguistic, evincing at the same time crosslinguistic commonalities as well as language-specific features (Candeaet al.2005; Dingemanse andWoensdregt2020). This study seeks to expand on understanding of these lexically peripheral items by analyzing their acoustic properties in Hong Kong Cantonese (HKCT), including vowel quality and F0. Recent work by Dingemanse and Woensdregt (2020) discusses phoneticsimilarities in HMs across languages, which are constrained by adherence to the phonologies of their respective languages. However, it is unclear how HMs are incorporated into HKCT tonal phonology, which can be characterized as 'omnisyllabic' (Matisoff 1995), every syllable being associated with a lexical tone.The present study gathers acoustic data (F0, F1-F2, duration) from the PolyU Corpus of Spoken Chinese (http://wongtaksum.no-ip.info:81/corpus.htm)across 10 speakers and 196 HMs, comparing them against 525 lexical items. Results for F1-F2 clusteredaround mid-front /epsilon/, which is in line both with around the lower end of the pitch range, approaching Tones 3 and 6, which is expected given effort minimization trends. However, establishing a connection with a particular lexical tone was complicated by the similarity of Tones 3 and 6, which could not be statistically distinguished. Cross-speaker analysis showed considerable variation in F0, indicating that context, intonation, or idiolectal variation may play a substantial role. This has implications for our understanding of how peripheral items likehesitation markers are treated in omnisyllabic tone languages like Cantonese.",,,,WOS:001339028600002,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",acoustic patterns in hong kong cantonese hesitation markers vowel quality and omnisyllabic tone,"Sevilla, RM",ut:WOS:001339028600002,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Modeling tone and intonation in Mandarin and English as a process of target approximation,"Prom-on, S; Xu, Y; Thipakorn, B",2009,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"This paper reports the development of a quantitative target approximation (qTA) model for generating F-0 contours of speech. The qTA model simulates the production of tone and intonation as a process of syllable-synchronized sequential target approximation [Xu, Y. (2005). ""Speech melody as articulatorily implemented communicative functions,"" Speech Commun. 46, 220-251]. It adopts a set of biomechanical and linguistic assumptions about the mechanisms of speech production. The communicative functions directly modeled are lexical tone in Mandarin and lexical stress in English and focus in both languages. The qTA model is evaluated by extracting function-specific model parameters from natural speech via supervised learning (automatic analysis by synthesis) and comparing the F-0 contours generated with the extracted parameters to those of natural utterances through numerical evaluation and perceptual testing. The F-0 contours generated by the qTA model with the learned parameters were very close to the natural contours in terms of root mean square error, rate of human identification of tone, and focus and judgment of naturalness by human listeners. The results demonstrate that the qTA model is both an effective tool for research on tone and intonation and a potentially effective system for automatic synthesis of tone and intonation.",,,10.1121/1.3037222,WOS:000262672600051,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",modeling tone and intonation in mandarin and english as a process of target approximation,"Prom-on, S",doi:10.1121/1.3037222,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese,"Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,WOS:000813299300001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",perception of different tone contrasts at sub lexical and lexical levels by dutch learners of mandarin chinese,"Zou, T",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(""spoken word recognition"" AND intonation) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",5
In defense of prosodic typology: A response to Beckman & Venditti,"Hyman, LM",2012,LINGUISTIC TYPOLOGY,"In two recent handbook articles, Beckman & Venditti (2010, 2011) present overviews of tone and intonation which take issue with both traditional typology and recent attempts to bring clarity to the study of prosodic typology. In the course of their coverage Beckman & Venditti question the ""usefulness"" of distinguishing prosodic systems by ""tonemic function alone"" (e.g., lexical tone, stress, intonation) and raise the question ""Is typology needed?"" Within this context I once again argue for a ""property-driven"" approach to prosodic typology whose goal is not to classify languages into prosodic types, rather to accurately characterize the same vs. different ways in which prosodic properties are exploited. We thus ask (i) whether a given language has word-level contrastive pitch (""tone""), word-level metrical structure (""stress""), both, or neither; (ii) if yes, what does the prosodic system do with the tones and/or stress, both at the word level and postlexically? Given the level-ordered nature of phonological systems, only after the first two questions are dealt with can we move on to the the question with which Beckman & Venditti are most concerned: (iii) how are the surface or output word-prosodic properties integrated with phrase-and utterance-level intonation? While Beckman & Venditti question the usefulness of ""broad-stroke typologies"" which have traditionally distinguished tone, stress, and intonation, their disposition to minimize systemic differences in favor of surface comparisons of phonetic realizations raises important questions concerning levels of representation and the nature of phonological typology itself.",,,10.1515/lingty-2012-0014,WOS:000209107800002,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",in defense of prosodic typology a response to beckman venditti,"Hyman, LM",doi:10.1515/lingty-2012-0014,"TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Research Article Tone Deafness in Music Does Not Preclude Distributional Learning of Nonnative Tonal Languages in Individuals With Congenital Amusia,"Zhu, JQ; Chen, XX; Chen, F; Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Wiener, S",2023,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: Previous studies have shown that individuals with congenital amusia exhibit deficient pitch processing across music and language domains. This study investigated whether adult Chinese-speaking listeners with amusia were still able to learn Thai lexical tones based on stimulus frequency of statistical distribution via distributional learning, despite their degraded lexical tone perception. Method: Following a pretest-training-posttest design, 21 amusics and 23 typical, musically intact listeners were assigned into bimodal and unimodal distribution conditions. Listeners were asked to discriminate minimal pairs of Thai midlevel tone and falling tone superimposed on variable base syllables and uttered by different speakers. The perceptual accuracy for each test session and improvement from pretest to posttest were collected and analyzed between the two groups using generalized mixed-effects models. Results: When discriminating Thai lexical tones, amusics were less accurate than typical listeners. Nonetheless, similarly to control listeners, perceptual gains from pretest to posttest were observed in bimodally rather than unimodally trained amusics, as evidenced by both trained and nontrained test words. Conclusions: Amusics are able to learn lexical tones in a second or foreign context of speech. This extends previous research by showing that amusics' distributional learning of linguistic pitch remains largely preserved despite their degraded pitch processing. It is thus likely that manifestations of amusia in speech could not result from their abnormal statistical learning mechanism. This study meanwhile provides a heuristic approach for future studies to apply this paradigm into amusics' treatment to mitigate their pitch-processing disorder.",,,10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00572,WOS:001041295400018,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",research article tone deafness in music does not preclude distributional learning of nonnative tonal languages in individuals with congenital amusia,"Zhu, JQ",doi:10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00572,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Deficits of congenital amusia beyond pitch: Evidence from impaired categorical perception of vowels in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Huang, XN",2017,PLOS ONE,"Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder of fine-grained pitch processing in music and speech. However, it remains unclear whether amusia is a pitch-specific deficit, or whether it affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly, such as the perception of formant frequency in vowels, apart from pitch. In this study, in order to illuminate the scope of the deficits, we compared the performance of 15 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 15 matched controls on the categorical perception of sound continua in four stimulus contexts: lexical tone, pure tone, vowel, and voice onset time (VOT). Whereas lexical tone, pure tone and vowel continua rely on frequency/spectral processing, the VOT continuum depends on duration/temporal processing. We found that the amusic participants performed similarly to controls in all stimulus contexts in the identification, in terms of the across-category boundary location and boundary width. However, the amusic participants performed systematically worse than controls in discriminating stimuli in those three contexts that depended on frequency/spectral processing (lexical tone, pure tone and vowel), whereas they performed normally when discriminating duration differences (VOT). These findings suggest that the deficit of amusia is probably not pitch specific, but affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly. Furthermore, there appeared to be differences in the impairment of frequency/spectral discrimination in speech and nonspeech contexts. The amusic participants exhibited less benefit in between-category discriminations than controls in speech contexts (lexical tone and vowel), suggesting reduced categorical perception; on the other hand, they performed inferiorly compared to controls across the board regardless of between-and within-category discriminations in nonspeech contexts (pure tone), suggesting impaired general auditory processing. These differences imply that the frequency/spectral-processing deficit might be manifested differentially in speech and nonspeech contexts in amusics D it is manifested as a deficit of higher-level phonological processing in speech sounds, and as a deficit of lower-level auditory processing in nonspeech sounds.",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0183151,WOS:000408085100029,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",deficits of congenital amusia beyond pitch evidence from impaired categorical perception of vowels in cantonese speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC",doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0183151,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
The phonetics of information structure in Yoloxochitl Mixtec,"DiCanio, C; Benn, J; García, RC",2018,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"Research on speech prosody has shown that higher-level phonological constituents can be examined directly via their influence on low level phonetic processes (Beckman & Edwards, 1990; Fougeron & Keating, 1997). Despite the strong tradition of research in this area, the existing work has focused mainly on languages which lack lexical tone. This contributes to the view that prosodic structures show little influence on tone, i.e. a language may either have lexical tone or lexical/phrasal stress, the latter of which fits into the prosodic hierarchy. The current paper examines prosodic focus in Yoloxochitl Mixtec, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in Mexico. Using experimental data from ten speakers in the field, we investigated how sentence position, stress, and focus type influenced the realization of F-o and duration in different tonal melodies. The findings show that the tonal F-o space was expanded and raised on words produced with contrastive focus, less on words produced with narrow focus, and least on words produced under broad, sentential focus. Focus-related lengthening asymmetrically affected stressed syllables in the language more than unstressed syllables. In stressed syllables, this resulted in an increase in tonal hyperarticulation.

Impaired perceptual normalization of lexical tones in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Chen, S",2018,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Human listeners perceive speech sounds relative to acoustic cues in context. In this study the authors examined how congenital amusia, a pitch-processing disorder, affects perceptual normalization of lexical tones according to the distribution of F0 cues in context. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 16 controls were tested on the effects of shifting F0 level in four types of contexts on tone perception: nonspeech, reversed speech, semantically anomalous speech, and meaningful speech contexts. Performance of controls replicated previous studies, showing contrastive changes of tone perception according to the shifted F0 level of anomalous and meaningful contexts, which were native speech contexts with phonological cues to estimate a talker's tone space. Effects of nonspeech and reversed contexts were small and inconsistent, and tone perception performance varied depending on the typicality of a talker's F0 range. In contrast to controls, amusics showed reduced context effects in anomalous and meaningful contexts, but largely comparable context effects in nonspeech and reversed contexts, indicating a deficit of amusics in tone normalization through phonological cues in native speech contexts. These findings suggest that the ability to perceive speech sounds relative to acoustic cues in context is not a universal endowment, and that this ability is impaired substantially in amusics.

It has been shown that native speakers of French, a language without lexical stress, have difficulties storing non-native stress contrasts. We investigated whether the ability to store lexical tone (as in Mandarin Chinese) also depends on the first language (L I) prosodic structure and, if so, how. We tested participants from a stress language (German), a language without word stress (French), a language with restricted lexical tonal contrasts (Japanese), and Mandarin Chinese controls. Furthermore, German has a rich intonational structure, while French and Japanese dispose of fewer utterance-level pitch contrasts. The participants learnt associations between disyllabic non-words (4 tonal contrasts) and objects and indicated whether picture word pairs matched with what they had learnt (complete match, segmental or tonal mismatch conditions). In the tonal mismatch condition, the Mandarin Chinese controls had the highest sensitivity, followed by the German participants.

Acoustic analyses showed that, compared with typically developing peers, children with ASD exhibited increased pitch variations when imitating lexical tones, while performed similarly when imitating the nonspeech counterparts.

Universals of listening: Equivalent prosodic entrainment in tone and non-tone languages,"Ip, MHK; Cutler, A",2020,COGNITION,"In English and Dutch, listeners entrain to prosodic contours to predict where focus will fall in an utterance. Here, we ask whether this strategy is universally available, even in languages with very different phonological systems (e.g., tone versus non-tone languages). In a phoneme detection experiment, we examined whether prosodic entrainment also occurs in Mandarin Chinese, a tone language, where the use of various suprasegmental cues to lexical identity may take precedence over their use in salience. Consistent with the results from Germanic languages, response times were facilitated when preceding intonation predicted high stress on the target-bearing word, and the lexical tone of the target word (i.e., rising versus falling) did not affect the Mandarin listeners' response. Further, the extent to which prosodic entrainment was used to detect the target phoneme was the same in both English and Mandarin listeners. Nevertheless, native Mandarin speakers did not adopt an entrainment strategy when the sentences were presented in English, consistent with the suggestion that L2 listening may be strained by additional functional load from prosodic processing. These findings have implications for how universal and language-specific mechanisms interact in the perception of focus structure in everyday discourse.",,,10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311,WOS:000551338900012,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",universals of listening equivalent prosodic entrainment in tone and non tone languages,"Ip, MHK",doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
How experience with tone in the native language affects the L2 acquisition of pitch accents,"Zahner-Ritter, K; Zhao, TY; Einfeldt, M; Braun, B",2022,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This paper tested the ability of Mandarin learners of German, whose native language has lexical tone, to imitate pitch accent contrasts in German, an intonation language. In intonation languages, pitch accents do not convey lexical information; also, pitch accents are sparser than lexical tones as they only associate with prominent words in the utterance. We compared two kinds of German pitch-accent contrasts: (1) a ""non-merger"" contrast, which Mandarin listeners perceive as different and (2) a ""merger"" contrast, which sounds more similar to Mandarin listeners. Speakers of a tone language are generally very sensitive to pitch. Hypothesis 1 (H1) therefore stated that Mandarin learners produce the two kinds of contrasts similarly to native German speakers. However, the documented sensitivity to tonal contrasts, at the expense of processing phrase-level intonational contrasts, may generally hinder target-like production of intonational pitch accents in the L2 (Hypothesis 2, H2). Finally, cross-linguistic influence (CLI) predicts a difference in the realization of these two contrasts as well as improvement with higher proficiency (Hypothesis 3, H3). We used a delayed imitation paradigm, which is well-suited for assessing L2-phonetics and -phonology because it does not necessitate access to intonational meaning. We investigated the imitation of three kinds of accents, which were associated with the sentence-final noun in short wh-questions (e.g., Wer malt denn Mandalas, lit: ""Who draws PRT mandalas?"" ""Who likes drawing mandalas?""). In Experiment 1, 28 native speakers of Mandarin participated (14 low- and 14 high-proficient). The learners' productions of the two kinds of contrasts were analyzed using General Additive Mixed Models to evaluate differences in pitch accent contrasts over time, in comparison to the productions of native German participants from an earlier study in our lab. Results showed a more pronounced realization of the non-merger contrast compared to German natives and a less distinct realization of the merger contrast, with beneficial effects of proficiency, lending support to H3. Experiment 2 tested low-proficient Italian learners of German (whose L1 is an intonation language) to contextualize the Mandarin data and further investigate CLI. Italian learners realized the non-merger contrast more target-like than Mandarin learners, lending additional support to CLI (H3).",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879,WOS:000861273800001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",how experience with tone in the native language affects the l2 acquisition of pitch accents,"Zahner-Ritter, K",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Effects of tone and focus on the formation and alignment of f0 contours,"Xu, Y",1999,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"The present study examines how lexical tone and focus contribute to the formation and alignment off, contours in speech. This was done through an investigation of f(0) contour formation in short Mandarin sentences. These sentences all consisted of five syllables with varying tones on the middle three syllables. The sentences were produced by eight Mandarin speakers with four different focus patterns: focus on the first, second, or last word, or with no narrow focus. The f(0) patterns of these sentences were examined through point-by-point f(0) tracing, graphical comparison of averaged f(0) contours, f(0)-contour-syllable alignment analysis, and analysis of maximum, minimum f(0), and slope of f(0) contours. The results indicate that (a) while the lexical tone of a syllable is the most important determining factor for the local f(0) contour of the syllable, focus extensively modulates the global shape of the f(0) curve, which in turn affects the height and even the shape of local contours; (b) the tones of adjacent syllables also extensively influence both the shape and height of the f(0) contour of a syllable, with the preceding tone exerting more influence than the following tone; (c) despite extensive variations in shape and height, the f(0) contour of a tone remains closely aligned with the associated syllable; and (d) both focus and tonal interaction may generate substantial f(0) decline over the course of an utterance. These findings seem to be able to reduce the unpredictability in the formation and alignment of f(0) contours in speech.

Perception of tones by bilingual infants learning non-tone languages,"Liu, LQ; Kager, R",2017,BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION,"This paper examines the ability of bilingual infants who were learning Dutch and another non-tone language to discriminate tonal contrasts. All infants from 5 to 18 months of age succeeded in discriminating a tonal contrast of Mandarin Chinese (Tone 1 versus Tone 4) and showed a U-shaped pattern when facing a less acoustically salient manipulated version (contracted) of the aforementioned contrast. Specifically, infants showed initial sensitivity to the contracted contrast during their early months, followed by a loss of sensitivity at the stage where tonal perceptual reorganization typically occurs, and a sensitivity rebound by the end of the first year after birth. Compared to a previous studying of ours testing monolingual Dutch infants (Liu & Kager, 2014), the discrimination patterns of bilingual infants revealed both similarities and differences. On one hand, as with monolinguals, non-tone-learning bilingual infants' tonal perception presented plasticity influenced by contrast acoustic salience along the trajectory of perceptual reorganization; as well as a general U-shaped perceptual pattern when discriminating non-native tones. On the other hand, bilingual infants appeared to regain sensitivity to the contracted tonal contrast at an earlier age (11-12 months) in comparison with monolinguals infants (17-18 months). We provide several explanations, stemming from the simultaneous exposure to two languages, to account for the 6-month bilingual perceptual plasticity from linguistic and cognitive perspectives. The overall outcomes of the study offer insights into the infant perceptual reorganization and language development trajectory, expand on the differences between monolingual and bilingual language development, and broaden our understanding of the influence of bilingual exposure to the perception of non-native contrasts in infancy from linguistic and cognitive perspectives.",,,10.1017/s1366728916000183,WOS:000399401100008,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",perception of tones by bilingual infants learning non tone languages,"Liu, LQ",doi:10.1017/s1366728916000183,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Deficits in the Sensitivity to Pitch Sweeps by School-Aged Children Wearing Cochlear Implants,"Deroche, MLD; Kulkarni, AM; Christensen, JA; Limb, CJ; Chatterjee, M",2016,FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE,"Sensitivity to static changes in pitch has been shown to be poorer in school-aged children wearing cochlear implants (Cis) than children with normal hearing (NH), but it is unclear whether this is also the case for dynamic changes in pitch. Yet, dynamically changing pitch has considerable ecological relevance in terms of natural speech, particularly aspects such as intonation, emotion, or lexical tone information. Twenty one children with NH and 23 children wearing a CI participated in this study, along with 18 NH adults and 6 CI adults for comparison. Listeners with Cls used their clinically assigned settings with envelope-based coding strategies. Percent correct was measured in one- or three-interval two-alternative forced choice tasks, for the direction or discrimination of harmonic complexes based on a linearly rising or falling fundamental frequency. Sweep rates were adjusted per subject, in a logarithmic scale, so as to cover the full extent of the psychometric function. Data for up- and down-sweeps were fitted separately, using a maximum-likelihood technique. Fits were similar for up- and down-sweeps in the discrimination task, but diverged in the direction task because psychometric functions for down-sweeps were very shallow. Hits and false alarms were then converted into d' and beta values, from which a threshold was extracted at a d' of 0.77. Thresholds were very consistent between the two tasks and considerably higher (worse) for CI listeners than for their NH peers. Thresholds were also higher for children than adults. Factors such as age at implantation, age at profound hearing loss, and duration of CI experience did not play any major role in this sensitivity. Thresholds of dynamic pitch sensitivity (in either task) also correlated with thresholds for static pitch sensitivity and with performance in tasks related to speech prosody.",,,10.3389/fnins.2016.00073,WOS:000371565200001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",deficits in the sensitivity to pitch sweeps by school aged children wearing cochlear implants,"Deroche, MLD",doi:10.3389/fnins.2016.00073,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Congenital amusia (or tone-deafness) interferes with pitch processing in tone languages,"Tillmann, B; Burnham, D; Nguyen, S; Grimault, N; Gosselin, N; Peretz, I",2011,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder that affects music processing and that is ascribed to a deficit in pitch processing. We investigated whether this deficit extended to pitch processing in speech, notably the pitch changes used to contrast lexical tones in tonal languages. Congenital amusics and matched controls, all non-tonal language speakers, were tested for lexical tone discrimination in Mandarin Chinese (Experiment 1) and in Thai (Experiment 2). Tones were presented in pairs and participants were required to make same/different judgments. Experiment 2 additionally included musical analogs of Thai tones for comparison. Performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls for all materials, suggesting a domain-general pitch-processing deficit.

Lexical and Prosodic Pitch Modifications in Cantonese Infant-directed Speech,"Wang, LC; Kalashnikova, M; Kager, R; Lai, R; Wong, PCM",2021,JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE,"The functions of acoustic-phonetic modifications in infant-directed speech (IDS) remain a question: do they specifically serve to facilitate language learning via enhanced phonemic contrasts (the hyperarticulation hypothesis) or primarily to improve communication via prosodic exaggeration (the prosodic hypothesis)? The study of lexical tones provides a unique opportunity to shed light on this, as lexical tones are phonemically contrastive, yet their primary cue, pitch, is also a prosodic cue. This study investigated Cantonese IDS and found increased intra-talker variation of lexical tones, which more likely posed a challenge to rather than facilitated phonetic learning. Although tonal space was expanded which could facilitate phonetic learning, its expansion was a function of overall intonational modifications. Similar findings were observed in speech to pets who should not benefit from larger phonemic distinction. We conclude that lexical-tone adjustments in IDS mainly serve to broadly enhance communication rather than specifically increase phonemic contrast for learners.",,,10.1017/s0305000920000707,WOS:000721289100009,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",lexical and prosodic pitch modifications in cantonese infant directed speech,"Wang, LC",doi:10.1017/s0305000920000707,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Brainstem encoding of speech and musical stimuli in congenital amusia: evidence from Cantonese speakers,"Liu, F; Maggu, AR; Lau, JCY; Wong, PCM",2015,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,"Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical processing that also impacts subtle aspects of speech processing. It remains debated at what stage(s) of auditory processing deficits in amusia arise. In this study, we investigated whether amusia originates from impaired subcortical encoding of speech On quiet and noise) and musical sounds in the brainstem. Fourteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 14 matched controls passively listened to six Cantonese lexical tones in quiet, two Cantonese tones in noise (signal-to-noise ratios at 0 and 20 dB), and two cello tones in quiet while their frequency-following responses (FFRs) to these tones were recorded. All participants also completed a behavioral lexical tone identification task. The results indicated normal brainstem encoding of pitch in speech On quiet and noise) and musical stimuli in amusics relative to controls, as measured by FFR pitch strength, pitch error, and stimulus-to-response correlation. There was also no group difference in neural conduction time or FFR amplitudes. Both groups demonstrated better FFRs to speech On quiet and noise) than to musical stimuli. However, a significant group difference was observed for tone identification, with amusics showing significantly lower accuracy than controls. Analysis of the tone confusion matrices suggested that amusics were more likely than controls to confuse between tones that shared similar acoustic features. Interestingly, this deficit in lexical tone identification was not coupled with brainstem abnormality for either speech or musical stimuli. Together, our results suggest that the amusic brainstem is not functioning abnormally, although higher-order linguistic pitch processing is impaired in amusia. This finding has significant implications for theories of central auditory processing, requiring further investigations into how different stages of auditory processing interact in the human brain.",,,10.3389/fnhum.2014.01029,WOS:000347516500002,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",brainstem encoding of speech and musical stimuli in congenital amusia evidence from cantonese speakers,"Liu, F",doi:10.3389/fnhum.2014.01029,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4
Perceptual assimilation of lexical tone: The roles of language experience and visual information,"Reid, A; Burnham, D; Kasisopa, B; Reilly, R; Attina, V; Rattanasone, NX; Best, CT",2015,ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS,"Using Best's (1995) perceptual assimilation model (PAM), we investigated auditory-visual (AV), auditory-only (AO), and visual-only (VO) perception of Thai tones. Mandarin and Cantonese (tone-language) speakers were asked to categorize Thai tones according to their own native tone categories, and Australian English (non-tone-language) speakers to categorize Thai tones into their native intonation categories-for instance, question or statement. As comparisons, Thai participants completed a straightforward identification task, and another Australian English group identified the Thai tones using simple symbols. All of the groups also completed an AX discrimination task. Both the Mandarin and Cantonese groups categorized AO and AV Thai falling tones as their native level tones, and Thai rising tones as their native rising tones, although the Mandarin participants found it easier to categorize Thai level tones than did the Cantonese participants. VO information led to very poor categorization for all groups, and AO and AV information also led to very poor categorizations for the English intonation categorization group. PAM's predictions regarding tone discriminability based on these category assimilation patterns were borne out for the Mandarin group's AO and AV discriminations, providing support for the applicability of the PAM to lexical tones. For the Cantonese group, however, PAM was unable to account for one specific discrimination pattern-namely, their relatively good performance on the Thai high-rising contrast in the auditory conditions-and no predictions could be derived for the English groups. A full account of tone assimilation will likely need to incorporate considerations of phonetic, and even acoustic, similarity and overlap between nonnative and native tone categories.",,,10.3758/s13414-014-0791-3,WOS:000350102800016,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",perceptual assimilation of lexical tone the roles of language experience and visual information,"Reid, A",doi:10.3758/s13414-014-0791-3,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Enhancement of temporal periodicity cues in cochlear implants: Effects on prosodic perception and vowel identification,"Green, T; Faulkner, A; Rosen, S; Macherey, O",2005,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Standard continuous interleaved sampling processing, and a modified processing strategy designed to enhance temporal cues to voice pitch, were compared on tests of intonation perception, and vowel perception, both in implant users and in acoustic simulations. In standard processing, 400 Hz low-pass envelopes modulated either pulse trains (implant users) or noise carriers (simulations). In the modified strategy, slow-rate envelope modulations, which convey dynamic spectral variation crucial for speech understanding, were extracted by low-pass filtering (32 Hz). In addition, during voiced speech, higher-rate temporal modulation in each channel was provided by 100% amplitude-modulation by a sawtooth-like wave form whose periodicity followed the fundamental frequency (FO) of the input. Channel levels were determined by the product of the lower- and higher-rate modulation components. Both in acoustic simulations and in implant users, the ability to use intonation information to identify sentences as question or statement was significantly better with modified processing. However, while there was no difference in vowel recognition in the acoustic simulation, implant users performed worse with modified processing both in vowel recognition and in formant frequency discrimination. It appears that, while enhancing pitch perception, modified processing harmed the transmission of spectral information.

No Musician Advantage in the Perception of Degraded-Fundamental Frequency Speech in Noisy Environments,"Hsieh, IH; Guo, YJ",2023,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,"Purpose: Pitch variations of the fundamental frequency (fo) contour contribute to speech perception in noisy environments, but whether musicians confer an advantage in speech in noise (SIN) with altered fo information remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different levels of degraded fo contour (i.e., conveying lexical tone or intonation information) on musician advantage in speech-in-noise perception.Method: A cohort of native Mandarin Chinese speakers, comprising 30 trained musicians and 30 nonmusicians, were tested on the intelligibility of Mandarin Chinese sentences with natural, flattened-tone, flattened-intonation, and flattened-all fo contours embedded in background noise masked under three signal-to-noise ratios (0, -5, and -9 dB). Pitch difference thresholds and innate musical skills associated with speech-in-noise benefits were also assessed.Results: Speech intelligibility score improved with increasing signal-to-noise level for both musicians and nonmusicians. However, no musician advantage was observed for identifying any type of flattened-fo contour SIN. Musicians exhibited smaller fo pitch discrimination limens than nonmusicians, which correlated with benefits for perceiving speech with intact tone-level fo information. Regardless of musician status, performance on the pitch and accent musical skill subtests correlated with speech intelligibility score. Conclusions: Collectively, these results provide no evidence for a musician advantage for perceiving speech with distorted fo information in noisy environments. Results further show that perceptual musical skills on pitch and accent processing may benefit the perception of SIN, independent of formal musical training. Our findings suggest that the potential application of music training in speech perception in noisy backgrounds is not contingent on the ability to process fo pitch contours, at least for Mandarin Chinese speakers.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23706354",,,10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00662,WOS:001056733600006,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",no musician advantage in the perception of degraded fundamental frequency speech in noisy environments,"Hsieh, IH",doi:10.1044/2023_jslhr-22-00662,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Development of tonal discrimination in young heritage speakers of Cantonese,"Kan, RTY; Schmid, MS",2019,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"This study uses the Perceptual Assimilation Model for Suprasegmentals (PAM-S) (So & Best, 2008, 2010), supported by the assumptions of the L2 Intonation Learning theory (LILt, Mennen, 2015), to investigate how young heritage speakers of Cantonese living in the United States acquired Cantonese tones. Sixty-seven heritage speakers, aged 5-11, were tested on their perception of Cantonese tonal contrasts using an ABX discrimination task. They were compared to 64 peers aged 5-12 in Hong Kong, where Cantonese is spoken as the majority language but English is also acquired from a young age. Two pairs of tones were tested: Tones 2 (mid rising) and 5 (low rising), which have similar pitch heights and contours, and Tones 1 (high level) and 4 (low falling), which have a larger phonetic contrast. As predicted, the heritage speakers were more accurate in discriminating between the more distinct pair of tones than between the more similar pair. They also scored lower than their peers from Hong Kong in both contrast conditions. Age of testing predicted accuracy for both groups, and Chinese literacy also had a significant effect for the heritage speakers. The potential lack of the Tone 2-5 contrast in the heritage speakers' input is discussed as an explanation for these findings. This study illustrates the divergence in heritage speakers' phonological development compared to majority language speakers, and shows the relevance of the PAM-S and LILt to the heritage language context.

There were no significant differences between modified processing and CIS in vowel recognition.

Question or tone 2? How language experience and linguistic function guide pitch processing,"Braun, B; Johnson, EK",2011,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"How does language experience shape pitch processing? Do speakers of tone languages, which use pitch to signal lexical contrasts (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) attend to pitch movements more closely than speakers of intonation languages (e.g., Dutch)? Contradictory findings have been reported in the literature. In the current study, we hypothesize that listeners should be particularly attentive to any pitch information that signals meaningful information in the native language. This includes pitch movements signaling lexical contrasts (present in tone languages only) as well as postlexical contrasts (present in all languages). Both Mandarin and Dutch listeners performed speeded ABX match to sample tasks on the same sets of nonsense words. As predicted, the same pitch movements were attended to differentially by the two language populations depending on the role that information played in the native language. Mandarin listeners were more attentive than Dutch listeners to pitch movements as these signaled potential lexical contrasts in Mandarin (but not Dutch). Importantly, Dutch listeners were more attentive to pitch movements signaling postlexical information than to pitch movements signaling no meaningful linguistic information. These findings underscore the importance of postlexical information in online speech processing and explain apparent contradictions in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Sequential perception of tone and focus in parallel-A computational simulation,"Chen, Y; Xu, Y",2025,SPEECH COMMUNICATION,"Speech is produced continuously over time. So, the information it conveys, including intonational functions, also unfolds over time. But many intonational functions are encoded across whole utterances rather than only within certain words. How can perception process speech signals continuously over time, even for communicative functions that are globally encoded? In this study we used computational simulation to test the idea that even for intonational functions with large temporal scopes, it is possible to process f0 contours syllable-by-syllable, and recognize the functions by continuous estimation of progressive probabilistic inference. We trained SVM and GRU models to simulate the perception of Mandarin tone and sentence focus with either syllable-sized or sentence-sized f0 contours as input. The sentence-wide f0 contours are gated at different syllable locations to test the incrementality of the recognition of tone and intonation. We also tested human listeners' perception of tone and focus with full and fragmented f0 contours from the same dataset to evaluate the validity of the simulated perception. The results showed that the simulated syllable-by-syllable processing of tone and focus generated the closest recognition patterns to human perception. The simulations also show that there is little difference whether tone and focus are recognized separately or as tone-focus combinations, which suggests that despite sharing the same acoustic dimension, the two functions are sufficiently separated from each other in their f0 coding.",,,10.1016/j.specom.2024.103173,WOS:001413433300001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",sequential perception of tone and focus in parallel a computational simulation,"Chen, Y",doi:10.1016/j.specom.2024.103173,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Talker normalization in typical Cantonese-speaking listeners and congenital amusics: Evidence from event-related potentials,"Shao, J; Zhang, CC",2019,NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL,"Despite the lack of invariance in the mapping between the acoustic signal and phonological representation, typical listeners are capable of using information of a talker's vocal characteristics to recognize phonemes, a process known as ""talker normalization"". The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100-150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the ""active control theory"". On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual ""anchoring"" deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.",,,10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814,WOS:000485804400006,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",talker normalization in typical cantonese speaking listeners and congenital amusics evidence from event related potentials,"Shao, J",doi:10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4
Hemispheric roles in the perception of speech prosody,"Gandour, J; Tong, YX; Wong, D; Talavage, T; Dzemidzic, M; Xu, YS; Li, XJ; Lowe, M",2004,NEUROIMAGE,"Speech prosody is processed in neither a single region nor a specific hemisphere, but engages multiple areas comprising a large-scale spatially distributed network in both hemispheres. It remains to be elucidated whether hemispheric lateralization is based on higher-level prosodic representations or lower-level encoding of acoustic cues, or both. A cross-language (Chinese; English) fMRI study was conducted to examine brain activity elicited by selective attention to Chinese intonation (I) and tone (T) presented in three-syllable (I3, T3) and one-syllable (I1, T1) utterance pairs in a speeded response, discrimination paradigm. The Chinese group exhibited greater activity than the English in a left inferior parietal region across tasks (I1, I3, T1, T3). Only the Chinese group exhibited a leftward asymmetry in inferior parietal and posterior superior temporal (I1, I3, T1, T3), anterior temporal (I1, I3, T1, T3), and frontopolar (I1, I3) regions. Both language groups shared a rightward asymmetry in the mid portions of the superior temporal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus irrespective of prosodic unit or temporal interval. Hemispheric laterality effects enable us to distinguish brain activity associated with higher-order prosodic representations in the Chinese group from that associated with lower-level acoustic/auditory processes that are shared among listeners regardless of language experience. Lateralization is influenced by language experience that shapes the internal prosodic representation of an external auditory signal. We propose that speech prosody perception is mediated primarily by the RH, but is left-lateralized to task-dependent regions when language processing is required beyond the auditory analysis of the complex sound.

"Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework","Deutsch, D; Henthorn, T",2004,MUSIC PERCEPTION,"Absolute pitch is generally considered to reflect a rare musical endowment; however, its characteristics are puzzling and its genesis is unclear. We describe two experiments in which native speakers of tone languages-Mandarin and Vietnamese-were found to display a remarkably precise and stable form of absolute pitch in enunciating words. We further describe a third experiment in which speakers of English displayed less stability on an analogous task. Based on these findings, and considering the related literatures on critical periods in speech development, and the neurological underpinnings of lexical tone, we propose a framework for the genesis of absolute pitch. The framework assumes that absolute pitch originally evolved as a feature of speech, analogous to other features such as vowel quality, and that speakers of tone language naturally acquire this feature during the critical period for speech acquisition. We further propose that the acquisition of absolute pitch by rare individuals who speak an intonation language may be associated with a critical period of unusually long duration, so that it encompasses the age at which the child can take music lessons. We conclude that the potential to acquire absolute pitch is universally present at birth, and that it can be realized by enabling the infant to associate pitches with verbal labels during the critical period for speech acquisition.",,,10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339,WOS:000220273000005,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",absolute pitch speech and tone language some experiments and a proposed framework,"Deutsch, D",doi:10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Normal pre-attentive and impaired attentive processing of lexical tones in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics,"Zhang, CC; Shao, J",2018,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"The neural underpinnings of congenital amusia, an innate neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing, are not well understood. Previous studies suggest that amusia primarily impairs attentive processing (P300) of small pitch deviations in music, leaving pre-attentive pitch processing (mismatch negativity or MMN) more or less intact. However, it remains unknown whether the same neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficiency underlies pitch processing in speech, where amusics also often show impairment behaviorally. The current study examined how lexical tones are processed in pre-attentive (MMN) and attentive (P300) conditions in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 matched controls. At the pre-attentive level, Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited normal MMN responses to lexical tone changes, even for tone pairs with small pitch differences (mid level vs. low level tone; high rising vs. low rising tone). However, at the attentive level, amusics exhibited reduced P3a amplitude for all tone pairs, and further reduced P3b amplitude for tone pairs with small pitch differences. These results suggest that the amusic brain detects tone changes normally pre-attentively, but shows impairment in consciously detecting the same tone differences.

Evaluation of the Optimized Pitch and Language Strategy in Cochlear Implant Recipients,"Vandali, A; Dawson, P; Au, A; Yu, YY; Brown, M; Goorevich, M; Cowan, R",2019,EAR AND HEARING,"Objectives: The Optimized Pitch and Language (OPAL) strategy enhances pitch perception through coding of fundamental frequency (F0) amplitude modulation information in the stimulus envelope delivered to a cochlear implant. Previous research using a prototype of the strategy demonstrated significant benefits in musical pitch and lexical tone discrimination tasks with no degradation in speech recognition when compared with the clinical Advanced Combination Encoder (ACE) strategy in a small group of subjects. Based on those studies, a modified version of the strategy was implemented in the commercial Nucleus CP900 series processor. The aims of the present study were to establish whether the CP900 OPAL implementation continued to provide improved F0 pitch perception in a speech intonation task with no degradation to speech perception in quiet and noise, when compared with the clinical ACE strategy in a larger cohort of subjects. Further aims were to evaluate fitting procedures and subject acclimatization to the strategy after take-home experience. Design: Twenty experienced adult cochlear implant recipients were enrolled in the study. Two subjects withdrew during the study leaving 18 sets of data for analysis. A repeated-measures single-subject design with take-home experience was used to test for improved speech intonation perception using OPAL compared with ACE and for comparable performance between strategies for open-set word recognition in quiet at two presentation levels, sentence recognition in adaptive 4-talker babble noise, and speech intelligibility ratings. The stimulation rate employed for OPAL was 1200 pulses per second/channel which was higher than the default clinical rate of 900 pulses per second/channel used for ACE by all subjects in the present study. Two variations of the OPAL ""F0 restore gain"" (the gain applied to restore the loudness of modulated channels) were investigated: ""custom"" measured per subject and ""default"" which was the average of all subject custom gains. Results: A significant group mean benefit on the intonation test of 8.5% points was shown for OPAL compared with ACE. There was a significant period of adaptation to OPAL with significantly poorer sentence in noise scores acutely and after only 2 weeks of take-home experience. After 4 weeks of take-home experience, comparable word perception in quiet and sentence perception in noise for OPAL were obtained. Furthermore, there was good subject acceptability in the field with comparable speech intelligibility ratings between strategies. Results of the fitting procedure showed that OPAL did not require any additional steps compared with fitting of ACE. A default F0 restore gain provided comparable outcomes to a custom gain setting. Conclusions: The CP900 OPAL implementation provided a significant benefit to perception of speech intonation when compared with ACE. Comparable speech perception (in quiet and noise) and subjective ratings of speech intelligibility between strategies were also achieved after a period of acclimatization. These outcomes are consistent with results of earlier studies using prototype versions of the strategy and reaffirm its potential for improvement of F0 pitch perception in speech while preserving coding of segmental speech information. Furthermore, the OPAL strategy can be programmed into subject's processors using the same fitting procedures used for ACE thereby simplifying its adoption in clinical settings.",,,10.1097/aud.0000000000000627,WOS:000466796000011,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",evaluation of the optimized pitch and language strategy in cochlear implant recipients,"Vandali, A",doi:10.1097/aud.0000000000000627,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
The affective iconicity of lexical tone: Evidence from standard Chinesea),"Zheng, TT; Levelt, CC; Chen, YY",2025,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Previous studies suggested that pitch characteristics of lexical tones in Standard Chinese influence various sensory perceptions, but whether they iconically bias emotional experience remained unclear. We analyzed the arousal and valence ratings of bi-syllabic words in two corpora (Study 1) and conducted an affect rating experiment using a carefully designed corpus of bi-syllabic words (Study 2). Two-alternative forced-choice tasks further tested the robustness of lexical tones' affective iconicity in an auditory nonce word context (Study 3). Hierarchical linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and cross-validation were employed to understand the relationship between lexical tones and the emotional responses of tone-carrying words. Results consistently indicated that words with a falling-falling tonal sequence, both real and nonce words, received higher arousal ratings than those with rising-rising and rising-low tones. Only in nonce words, the high-high sequence was more likely to be associated with the low-arousal option; the falling-falling tone sequence was more often linked to negative-valence choice, while high-high and rising-rising tones with positive-valence. These findings, though subtle, suggest that the use of pitch in lexical tones influences emotional responses during the processing of tone-carrying words, pointing to an inherent iconic quality in lexical tones that may subtly shape speakers' emotional experiences.",,,10.1121/10.0034863,WOS:001405930900002,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",the affective iconicity of lexical tone evidence from standard chinesea,"Zheng, TT",doi:10.1121/10.0034863,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",3
Mandarin tone recognition in English speakers with normal hearing and with cochlear implants,"Nie, K; Hannaford, S; Director, HM; Nishigaki, MA; Drennan, WR; Rubinstein, JT",2019,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY,"Objective: Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant users have difficulty perceiving tonal changes in speech with current signal processing strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether English-speaking cochlear implant and normal hearing listeners can be trained to recognise closed-set Mandarin tones. The validity of using native-English speakers to evaluate Mandarin tone perception in cochlear implants was tested. Design: Two groups of native-English speaking participants were evaluated. All listeners were given training rounds and evaluation rounds in which their tonal identification was tested. The normal-hearing group was also tested with acoustic simulations of the traditional Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) strategy. Study sample: Ten normal-hearing English speakers and seven cochlear implant listeners participated. Results: The normal-hearing group correctly identified unprocessed tones at 87% and CIS-processed tones at 58% on average. The cochlear implant listeners achieved 56% correct identification on average.

Musicality and Age Interaction in Tone Development,"Rhee, N; Chen, AJ; Kuang, JJ",2022,FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE,"Vocal pitch, which involves not only F0 but also multiple covarying acoustic cues is central to linguistic perception and production at various levels of prosodic structure. Recent studies on language development have shown that differences in learners' musicality affect the F0 cue development in perception of sentence-level intonation or in prosodic realization of focus. This study aims to contribute toward a fuller understanding of the effect of musicality on linguistic pitch development via a close investigation of the relationship between musicality, age, and lexical tone production covering both F0 and spectral cues in children. Forty-three native Mandarin-speaking children between the ages of 4 and 6 years are recruited to participate in both a semi-spontaneous tone production task and a musicality test. For each age (4, 5, and 6 years) and musicality (below or above the median score of each age group) group, the contrastivity of the four tones is evaluated by performing automatic tone classification using three sets of acoustic cues (F0, spectral cues, and both). It has been found that higher musicality is associated with higher contrastivity of the tones produced at the age of 4 and 5 years, but not at the age of 6 years. These results suggest that musicality promotes earlier development of tone production only in earlier stages of prosodic development; by the age of 6 years, the musicality advantage in tone production subsides.",,,10.3389/fnins.2022.804042,WOS:000766956500001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",musicality and age interaction in tone development,"Rhee, N",doi:10.3389/fnins.2022.804042,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Post-low bouncing in Mandarin Chinese: Acoustic analysis and computational modeling,"Prom-on, S; Liu, F; Xu, Y",2012,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Post-low bouncing is a phenomenon whereby after reaching a very low pitch in a low lexical tone, F-0 bounces up and then gradually drops back in the following syllables. This paper reports the results of an acoustic analysis of the phenomenon in two Mandarin Chinese corpora and presents a simple mechanical model that can effectively simulate this bouncing effect. The acoustic analysis shows that most of the F-0 dynamic features profiling the bouncing effect strongly correlate with the amount of F-0 lowering in the preceding low-tone syllable, and that the additional F-0 raising commences at the onset of the first post-low syllable. Using the quantitative Target Approximation model, this bouncing effect was simulated by adding an acceleration adjustment to the initial F-0 state of the first post-low syllable. A highly linear relation between F-0 lowering and estimated acceleration adjustment was found. This relation was then used to effectively simulate the bouncing effect in both the neutral tone and the full tones. The results of the analysis and simulation are consistent with the hypothesis that the bouncing effect is due to a temporary perturbation of the balance between antagonistic forces in the laryngeal control in producing a very low pitch.

Spoken word recognition in young tone language learners: Age-dependent effects of segmental and suprasegmental variation,"Ma, WY; Zhou, P; Singh, L; Gao, LQ",2017,COGNITION,"The majority of the world's languages rely on both segmental (vowels, consonants) and suprasegmental (lexical tones) information to contrast the meanings of individual words. However, research on early language development has mostly focused on the acquisition of vowel-consonant languages. Developmental research comparing sensitivity to segmental and suprasegmental features in young tone learners is extremely rare. This study examined 2- and 3-year-old monolingual tone learners' sensitivity to vowels and tones. Experiment la tested the influence of vowel and tone variation on novel word learning. Vowel and tone variation hindered word recognition efficiency in both age groups. However, tone variation hindered word recognition accuracy only in 2-year-olds, while 3-year-olds were insensitive to tone variation. Experiment 1b demonstrated that 3-year-olds could use tones to learn new words when additional support was provided, and additionally, that Tone 3 words were exceptionally difficult to learn. Experiment 2 confirmed a similar pattern of results when children were presented with familiar words. This study is the first to show that despite the importance of tones in tone languages, vowels maintain primacy over tones in young children's word recognition and that tone sensitivity in word learning and recognition changes between 2 and 3 years of age. The findings suggest that early lexical processes are more tightly constrained by variation in vowels than by tones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Chinese-English Speakers' Perception of Pitch in Their Non-Tonal Language: Reinterpreting English as a Tonal-Like Language,"Ortega-Llebaria, M; Wu, ZH",2021,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"Changing the F0-contour of English words does not change their lexical meaning. However, it changes the meaning in tonal languages such as Mandarin. Given this important difference and knowing that words in the two languages of a bilingual lexicon interact, the question arises as to how Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in their bilingual lexicon. The few studies that addressed this question showed that Mandarin-English speakers did not perceive pitch in English words as native English speakers did. These studies, however, used English words as stimuli failing to examine nonwords and Mandarin words. Consequently, possible pre-lexical effects and L1 transfer were not ruled out. The present study fills this gap by examining pitch perception in Mandarin and English words and nonwords by Mandarin-English speakers and a group of native English controls. Results showed the tonal experience of Chinese-English speakers modulated their perception of pitch in their non-tonal language at both pre-lexical and lexical levels. In comparison to native English controls, tonal speakers were more sensitive to the acoustic salience of F0-contours in the pre-lexical processing due to top-down feedback. At the lexical level, Mandarin-English speakers organized words in their two languages according to similarity criteria based on both F0 and segmental information, whereas only the segmental information was relevant to the control group. These results in perception together with consistently reported production patterns in previous literature suggest that Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in English as if it was a one-tone language.",,,10.1177/0023830919894606,WOS:000507060400001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",chinese english speakers perception of pitch in their non tonal language reinterpreting english as a tonal like language,"Ortega-Llebaria, M",doi:10.1177/0023830919894606,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(""representation"" AND (""intonation"" OR ""prosody"")) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",4
THE PROSODIC SISTEM OF PRAZNICA,"Biocina, Z; Varosanec-Skaric, G; Basic, I",2018,FLUMINENSIA,"This paper examines the prosodic system of the Cakavian dialect of Praznica. Previous studies of Cakavian dialects spoken on the island of Brac have revealed the existence of a classic Cakavian three-accent system, consisting of a short-falling accent, a long-falling accent, and an acute, as well as pre-accentual length. This paper does not intend to question previous studies of the Brac local dialects, because these have been based mainly on listeners' perceptions, but it intends to demonstrate and describe the complex prosodic system of the dialect of Praznica through acoustic analysis. Furthermore, the paper aims to find out if older speakers have preserved a more archaic prosodic system in comparison with groups of younger and middle-aged speakers. For this purpose, 15 speakers were recorded and divided into groups according to age and gender. The criteria for selecting the speakers were that they had to be originally from Praznica, that they had lived there for the last 10 years, and that both of their parents were from Praznica. The material for recording consisted of an open list of topics for spontaneous spoken utterance. Words with the least influence of sentence intonation on the lexical tone were chosen for acoustic analysis in Praat. Frequency direction, frequency range, and duration as well as the tone level of the post-accented syllable were calculated and examined for vowels with different accents and phonological quantity. The results of the acoustic analysis show that the speakers from Praznica, apart from the expected three Cakavian accents and pre-accentual length, also have short-rising and long-rising accents and post-accentual length. No major differences were found in the prosodic system in terms of age or gender, except for greater tone differentiation among female speakers.",,,10.31820/f.30.1.6,WOS:000433006000008,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",the prosodic sistem of praznica,"Biocina, Z",doi:10.31820/f.30.1.6,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Lexical Tones in Mandarin Chinese Infant-Directed Speech: Age-Related Changes in the Second Year of Life,"Han, MR; de Jong, NH; Kager, R",2018,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Tonal information is essential to early word learning in tone languages. Although numerous studies have investigated the intonational and segmental properties of infant-directed speech (IDS), only a few studies have explored the properties of lexical tones in IDS. These studies mostly focused on the first year of life; thus little is known about how lexical tones in IDS change as children's vocabulary acquisition accelerates in the second year (Goldfield and Reznick, 1990; Bloom, 2001). The present study examines whether Mandarin Chinese mothers hyperarticulate lexical tones in IDS addressing 18-and 24-month-old children-at which age children are learning words at a rapid speed-vs. adult-directed speech (ADS). Thirty-nine Mandarin Chinese-speaking mothers were tested in a semi-spontaneous picture-book-reading task, in which they told the same story to their child (IDS condition) and to an adult (ADS condition). Results for the F0 measurements (minimum F0, maximum F0, and F0 range) of tone in the speech data revealed a continuum of differences among IDS addressing 18-month-olds, IDS addressing 24-month-olds, and ADS. Lexical tones in IDS addressing 18-month-old children had a higher minimum F0, higher maximum F0, and larger pitch range than lexical tones in ADS. Lexical tones in IDS addressing 24-month-old children showed more similarity to ADS tones with respect to pitch height: there were no differences in minimum F0 and maximum F0 between ADS and IDS. However, F0 range was still larger. These results suggest that lexical tones are generally hyperarticulated in Mandarin Chinese IDS addressing 18-and 24-month-old children despite the change in pitch level over time. Mandarin Chinese mothers hyperarticulate lexical tones in IDS when talking to toddlers and potentially facilitate tone acquisition and word learning.",,,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00434,WOS:000429243200001,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",lexical tones in mandarin chinese infant directed speech age related changes in the second year of life,"Han, MR",doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00434,"TS=(""lexical tone"" AND (recognition OR perception)) | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
Auditory Discrimination of Lexical Stress Patterns in Hearing-Impaired Infants with Cochlear Implants Compared with Normal Hearing: Influence of Acoustic Cues and Listening Experience to the Ambient Language,"Segal, O; Houston, D; Kishon-Rabin, L",2016,EAR AND HEARING,"Objectives: To assess discrimination of lexical stress pattern in infants with cochlear implant (CI) compared with infants with normal hearing (NH). While criteria for cochlear implantation have expanded to infants as young as 6 months, little is known regarding infants' processing of suprasegmental-prosodic cues which are known to be important for the first stages of language acquisition. Lexical stress is an example of such a cue, which, in hearing infants, has been shown to assist in segmenting words from fluent speech and in distinguishing between words that differ only the stress pattern. To date, however, there are no data on the ability of infants with CIs to perceive lexical stress. Such information will provide insight to the speech characteristics that are available to these infants in their first steps of language acquisition. This is of particular interest given the known limitations that the CI device has in transmitting speech information that is mediated by changes in fundamental frequency. Design: Two groups of infants participated in this study. The first group included 20 profoundly hearing-impaired infants with CI, 12 to 33 months old, implanted under the age of 2.5 years (median age of implantation = 14.5 months), with 1 to 6 months of CI use (mean = 2.7 months) and no known additional problems. The second group of infants included 48 NH infants, 11 to 14 months old with normal development and no known risk factors for developmental delays. Infants were tested on their ability to discriminate between nonsense words that differed on their stress pattern only (/doti/ versus /doti/ and /doti/ versus /doti/) using the visual habituation procedure. The measure for discrimination was the change in looking time between the last habituation trial (e.g., /doti/) and the novel trial (e.g., /doti/). Results: (1) Infants with CI showed discrimination between lexical stress pattern with only limited auditory experience with their implant device, (2) discrimination of stress patterns in infants with CI was reduced compared with that of infants with NH, (3) both groups showed directional asymmetry in discrimination, that is, increased discrimination from the uncommon to the common stress pattern in Hebrew (/doti/ versus /doti/) compared with the reversed condition. Conclusions: The CI device transmitted sufficient acoustic information (amplitude, duration, and fundamental frequency) to allow discrimination between stress patterns in young hearing-impaired infants with CI. The present pattern of results is in support of a discrimination model in which both auditory capabilities and ""top-down"" interactions are involved. That is, the CI infants detected changes between stressed and unstressed syllables after which they developed a bias for the more common weak-strong stress pattern in Hebrew. The latter suggests that infants with CI were able to extract the statistical distribution of stress patterns by listening to the ambient language even after limited auditory experience with the CI device. To conclude, in relation to processing of lexical stress patterns, infants with CI followed similar developmental milestones as hearing infants thus establishing important prerequisites for early language acquisition.",,,10.1097/aud.0000000000000243,WOS:000371748300011,"TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",auditory discrimination of lexical stress patterns in hearing impaired infants with cochlear implants compared with normal hearing influence of acoustic cues and listening experience to the ambient language,"Segal, O",doi:10.1097/aud.0000000000000243,"TS=(""processing"" AND ""intonation"" AND ""tone"") | TS=(intonation AND (""lexical tone"" OR ""tone perception""))",2
