A retrospective cohort study. A tertiary referred center. Fourteen children with cochlear implant (CI) in the experimental group, and 9 normal hearing children in the control group were enrolled in this study. Cochlear implantation and hearing rehabilitation. Two speech recognition accuracies were examined: (1) Lexical tone recognition (4-alternative forced choice, AFC), (2) English Sentence Intonation (2AFC). The overall accuracies for tone perception are 61.13% (standard deviation, SD = 10.84%) for CI group and 93.82% (SD = 1.80%) for normal hearing group. Tone 4 and Tone 1 were more easily to be recognized than tone 2 and tone 3 in the pediatric CI recipients (cCI) group. In English intonation perception, the overall accuracies are 61.82% (SD = 16.85%) for CI group, and 97.59% (SD = 4.73%) for normal hearing group. Significant high correlation (R = .919, P <= .000) between lexical tone perception and English intonation perception is noted. There is no significant difference for English intonation perception accuracies between Mandarin-speaking cCI (61.82%) and English-speaking cCI (70.13%, P = .11). Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children showed significant deficits in perception of lexical tone and English intonation relative to normal hearing children. There was no tonal language benefit in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children's English intonation perception, compared to the English-speaking cochlear-implanted peers. For cochlear-implanted children, better lexical tone perception comes with better English intonation perception. Enhancing Mandarin prosodic perception for cochlear-implanted children may benefit their command of intonation in English.												2	2											JUL 15	2022	101	28							e29567	10.1097/MD.0000000000029567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029567												2026-01-16	WOS:000825571400034
J	Morett, LM				Morett, Laura M.			The Influence of Tonal and Atonal Bilingualism on Children's Lexical and Non-Lexical Tone Perception	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study examined how bilingualism in an atonal language, in addition to a tonal language, influences lexical and non-lexical tone perception and word learning during childhood. Forty children aged 5;3-7;2, bilingual either in English and Mandarin or English and another atonal language, were tested on Mandarin lexical tone discrimination, level-pitch sine-wave tone discrimination, and learning of novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone. Mandarin-English bilingual children discriminated between and learned novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone more accurately than their atonal-English bilingual peers. However, Mandarin-English and atonal-English bilingual children discriminated between level-pitch sine-wave tones with similar accuracy. Moreover, atonal-English bilingual children showed a tendency to perceive differing Mandarin lexical and level-pitch sine-wave tones as identical, whereas their Mandarin-English peers showed no such tendency. These results indicate that bilingualism in a tonal language in addition to an atonal language-but not bilingualism in two atonal languages-allows for continued sensitivity to lexical tone beyond infancy. Moreover, they suggest that although tonal-atonal bilingualism does not enhance sensitivity to differences in pitch between sine-wave tones beyond infancy any more effectively than atonal-atonal bilingualism, it protects against the development of biases to perceive differing lexical and non-lexical tones as identical. Together, the results indicate that, beyond infancy, tonal-atonal bilinguals process lexical tones using different cognitive mechanisms than atonal-atonal bilinguals, but that both groups process level-pitch non-lexical tone using the same cognitive mechanisms.												7	8											JUN	2020	63	2					221	241		10.1177/0023830919834679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830919834679												2026-01-16	WOS:000537760600002

EARLY CORTICAL PROCESSING OF LINGUISTIC PITCH PATTERNS AS REVEALED BY THE MISMATCH NEGATIVITY	NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Previous brain imaging studies have shown the left hemispheric dominance for processing of lexical tone in native speakers. However, the low temporal resolution related to neuroimaging techniques might not explicitly detect the brain activities that occur at a relatively small or a determined time frame. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and a source estimation technique (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) to probe the brain activities underlying the early pre-attentive processing of Mandarin lexical tone and intonation. A passive oddball paradigm was applied to present tone and intonation contrast in a speech and nonspeech context. The results showed that no difference of the MMN amplitudes existed between speech and nonspeech conditions, although a larger MMN was found for tone than intonation condition. Source localization of the MMNs for all of the conditions showed the right hemispheric dominance, regardless of their linguistic functions (tone vs. intonation) or speech context (speech vs. nonspeech). Interestingly, the MMN generator for normal tone and hummed tone originated from the same cortical area (right parietal lobe, BA 19). These findings suggest that the pre-attentive cortical processing can be modulated not only by speech stimuli, but also by their nonspeech hums. Our data are compatible with the acoustic hypothesis of speech processing. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

Pitch perception and production in congenital amusia: Evidence from Cantonese speakers	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This study investigated pitch perception and production in speech and music in individuals with congenital amusia (a disorder of musical pitch processing) who are native speakers of Cantonese, a tone language with a highly complex tonal system. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics and 16 controls performed a set of lexical tone perception, production, singing, and psychophysical pitch threshold tasks. Their tone production accuracy and singing proficiency were subsequently judged by independent listeners, and subjected to acoustic analyses. Relative to controls, amusics showed impaired discrimination of lexical tones in both speech and non-speech conditions. They also received lower ratings for singing proficiency, producing larger pitch interval deviations and making more pitch interval errors compared to controls. Demonstrating higher pitch direction identification thresholds than controls for both speech syllables and piano tones, amusics nevertheless produced native lexical tones with comparable pitch trajectories and intelligibility as controls. Significant correlations were found between pitch threshold and lexical tone perception, music perception and production, but not between lexical tone perception and production for amusics. These findings provide further evidence that congenital amusia is a domain-general language-independent pitch-processing deficit that is associated with severely impaired music perception and production, mildly impaired speech perception, and largely intact speech production.

Design: Lexical tone perception and melodic contour identification (MCI) were measured in 21 prelingual and 11 postlingual young (aged 6-26 years) Mandarin-speaking CI users. Lexical tone recognition was measured for four tonal patterns: tone 1 (flat F0), tone 2 (rising F0), tone 3 (falling-rising F0), and tone 4 (falling F0). MCI was measured using nine five-note melodic patterns that contained changes in pitch contour, as well as different semitone spacing between notes. Results: Lexical tone recognition was generally good (overall mean = 81% correct), and there was no significant difference between subject groups. MCI performance was generally poor (mean = 23% correct). MCI performance was significantly better for postlingual (mean = 32% correct) than for prelingual CI participants (mean = 18% correct). After correcting for outliers, there was no significant correlation between lexical tone recognition and MCI performance for prelingual or postlingual CI participants. Age at deafness was significantly correlated with MCI performance only for postlingual participants. CI experience was significantly correlated with MCI performance for both prelingual and postlingual participants. Duration of deafness was significantly correlated with tone recognition only for prelingual participants. Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of pitch cues in Mandarin, the present CI participants had great difficulty perceiving melodic pitch. The availability of amplitude and duration cues in lexical tones most likely compensated for the poor pitch perception observed with these CI listeners. Previous acoustic hearing experience seemed to benefit postlingual CI users' melodic pitch perception. Longer CI experience was associated with better MCI performance for both subject groups, suggesting that CI users' music perception may improve as they gain experience with their device.												38	51											JAN	2015	36	1					102	110		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000086												2026-01-16	WOS:000346911200011

We examined this music-language relationship by investigating to what extent pitch deficits in these two domains were dissociable. We focused on a special neurodevelopmental pitch disorder congenital amusia, which primarily affects musical pitch processing. Recent research has also revealed lexical tone deficits in speech among amusics. Approximately one-third of Mandarin amusics exhibits behavioural difficulties in lexical tone perception, which is known as tone agnosia. Using mismatch negativities (MMNs), our current work probed lexical tone encoding at the pre-attentive level among the Mandarin amusics with (tone agnosics) and without (pure amusics) behavioural lexical tone deficits compared with age- and IQ-matched controls. Relative to the controls and the pure amusics, the tone agnosics exhibited reduced MMNs specifically in response to lexical tone changes. Their tone-consonant MMNs were intact and similar to those of the other two groups. Moreover, the tone MMN reduction over the left hemisphere was tightly linked to behavioural insensitivity to lexical tone changes. The current study thus provides the first psychophysiological evidence of subgroup differences in lexical tone processing among Mandarin amusics and links amusics' behavioural tone deficits to impaired pre-attentive tone processing. Despite the overall music pitch deficits, the subgroup differences in lexical tone processing in Mandarin-speaking amusics suggest dissociation of pitch deficits between music and speech.

Its linguistic consequences have been examined separately for speech intonations and lexical tones. However, in a tonal language such as Chinese, the processing of intonations and lexical tones interacts with each other during online speech perception. Whether and how the musical pitch disorder might affect linguistic pitch processing during online speech perception remains unknown. Method: We investigated this question with intonation (question vs. statement) and lexical tone (rising Tone 2 vs. falling Tone 4) identification tasks using the same set of sentences, comparing behavioral and event -related potential measurements between Mandarin -speaking amusics and matched controls. We specifically focused on the amusics without behavioral lexical tone deficits (the majority, i.e., pure amusics). Results: Results showed that, despite relative to normal performance when tested in word lexical tone test, pure amusics demonstrated inferior recognition than controls during sentence tone and intonation identification. Compared to controls, pure amusics had larger N400 amplitudes in question stimuli during tone task and smaller P600 amplitudes in intonation task. Conclusion: These data indicate that musical pitch disorder affects both tone and intonation processing during sentence processing even for pure amusics, whose lexical tone processing was intact when tested with words.												0	0											APR	2024	67	4					1107	1116		10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00520												2026-01-16	WOS:001244512900006
J	Kung, C; Chwilla, DJ; Schriefers, H				Kung, Carmen; Chwilla, Dorothee J.; Schriefers, Herbert			The interaction of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context in on-line spoken word recognition: An ERP study on Cantonese Chinese	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								In two ERP experiments, we investigate the on-line interplay of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context during spoken word recognition in Cantonese Chinese. Experiment 1 shows that lexical tone and intonation interact immediately. Words with a low lexical tone at the end of questions (with a rising question intonation) lead to a processing conflict. This is reflected in a low accuracy in lexical identification and in a P600 effect compared to the same words at the end of a statement. Experiment 2 shows that a strongly biasing semantic context leads to much better lexical-identification performance for words with a low tone at the end of questions and to a disappearance of the P600 effect. These results support the claim that semantic context plays a major role in disentangling the tonal information from the intonational information, and thus, in resolving the on-line conflict between intonation and tone. However, the ERP data indicate that the introduction of a semantic context does not entirely eliminate on-line processing problems for words at the end of questions. This is revealed by the presence of an N400 effect for words with a low lexical tone and for words with a high-mid lexical tone at the end of questions. The ERP data thus show that, while semantic context helps in the eventual lexical identification, it makes the deviation of the contextually expected lexical tone from the actual acoustic signal more salient.

JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS				Article								This paper investigates the intonation of other-initiation of repair in Standard Vietnamese and provides an analysis of its interaction with lexical tone at the word level. Results from both single-word and multi-word utterances show that speakers make predominant use of a rising pitch contour to mark other-initiation of repair, a contour that has been found in a large number of languages. This rise occurs consistently at the right edge of utterances and may be analysed as a phonetic reflex of a high boundary tone that can overlap, partially or completely, with the lexical tone of an utterance-final word. Further, the study demonstrates the application of talk-in-interaction to the study of the relation between lexical tone and intonation in tone languages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among Mandarin speakers, some amusics also have difficulties in processing lexical tones (tone agnosics). To examine to what extent these perceptual deficits may be related to pitch production impairments in music and Mandarin speech, eight amusics, eight tone agnosics, and 12 age- and IQ-matched normal native Mandarin speakers were asked to imitate music note sequences and Mandarin words of comparable lengths. The results indicated that both the amusics and tone agnosics underperformed the controls on musical pitch production. However, tone agnosics performed no worse than the amusics, suggesting that lexical tone perception deficits may not aggravate musical pitch production difficulties. Moreover, these three groups were all able to imitate lexical tones with perfect intelligibility. Taken together, the current study shows that perceptual musical pitch and lexical tone deficits might coexist with musical pitch production difficulties. But at the same time these perceptual pitch deficits might not affect lexical tone production or the intelligibility of the speech words that were produced. The perception-production relationship for pitch among individuals with perceptual pitch deficits may be, therefore, domain-dependent.												18	19											JAN 16	2014	4								1024	10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01024	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01024												2026-01-16	WOS:000331262500001

In this study, we employed whispered speech to examine an unresolved issue about congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical pitch processing, which also affects speech pitch processing such as lexical tone and intonation perception. The controversy concerns whether amusia is a pitch-processing disorder or can affect speech processing beyond pitch. Method: We examined lexical tone and intonation recognition in 19 Mandarin-speaking amusics and 19 matched controls in phonated and whispered speech, where fundamental frequency (f(o)) information is either present or absent. Results: The results revealed that the performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls in lexical tone identification in both phonated and whispered speech. These impairments were also detected in identifying intonation (statements/questions) in phonated and whispered modes. Across the experiments, regression models revealed that f(o) and non-f(o) (duration, intensity, and formant frequency) acoustic cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in phonated speech, whereas non-f(o) cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in whispered speech. There were significant differences between amusics and controls in the use of both f(o) and non-f(o) cues. Conclusion: The results provided the first evidence that the impairments of amusics in lexical tone and intonation identification prevail into whispered speech and support the hypothesis that the deficits of amusia extend beyond pitch processing.												3	4											APR	2022	65	4					1331	1348		10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00345												2026-01-16	WOS:000830953900007

Individuals with congenital amusia do not show context-dependent perception of tonal categories	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								Perceptual adaptation is an active cognitive process where listeners re-analyse speech categories based on new contexts/situations/talkers. It involves top-down influences from higher cortical levels on lower-level auditory processes. Individuals with congenital amusia have impaired pitch processing with reduced connectivity between frontal and temporal regions. This study examined whether deficits in amusia would lead to impaired perceptual adaptation in lexical tone perception. Thirteen Mandarin-speaking amusics and 13 controls identified the category of target tones on an 8-step continuum ranging from rising to high-level, either in isolation or in a high-/ low-pitched context. For tones with no context, amusics exhibited reduced categorical perception than controls. While controls? lexical tone categorization demonstrated a significant context effect due to perceptual adaptation, amusics showed similar categorization patterns across both contexts. These findings suggest that congenital amusia impacts the extraction of context-dependent tonal categories in speech perception, indicating that perceptual adaptation may depend on listeners? perceptual acuity.												9	9											APR	2021	215								104908	10.1016/j.bl.2021.104908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bl.2021.104908												2026-01-16	WOS:000636792100002

Positive changes have been noted after treatment not only for vocal loudness but also for many other speech dimensions, including intonation (monotonicity). There have been few studies investigating the effect of LSVT on lexical tone which, like intonation, is controlled by variations in fundamental frequency. This study involved 12 Cantonese speakers with idiopathic PD who were enrolled in a standard LVST treatment protocol. Speech data were collected 3-4 days before treatment and 1 day after treatment. A wide variety of perceptual and acoustic variables were analyzed. The results showed significant improvements in loudness and intonation after treatment, but no significant changes in lexical tone.

A series of language, auditory, and linguistic prosodic tests were given to 100 preschool children who had not yet learned how to read Chinese characters. The results suggested that lexical tone sensitivity and intonation production were significantly correlated with children's general vocabulary abilities. In particular, tone awareness was associated with comprehensive language development, whereas intonation production was associated with both comprehensive and expressive language development. Regression analyses revealed that tone sensitivity accounted for 36% of the unique variance in vocabulary development, whereas intonation production accounted for 6% of the variance in vocabulary development. Moreover, auditory frequency discrimination was significantly correlated with lexical tone sensitivity, syllable duration discrimination, and intonation production in Mandarin Chinese. Also it provided significant contributions to tone sensitivity and intonation production. Auditory frequency discrimination may indirectly affect early vocabulary development through Chinese speech prosody.												8	10											OCT	2016	123	2					365	382		10.1177/0031512516663164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0031512516663164												2026-01-16	WOS:000382950300001

INFANCY				Article								The ability to distinguish phonetic variations in speech that are relevant to meaning is essential for infants' language development. Previous studies into the acquisition of prosodic categories have focused on lexical stress, lexical pitch accent, or lexical tone. However, very little is known about the developmental course of infants' perception of linguistic intonation. In this study, we investigate infants' perception of the correlates of the statement/yes-no question contrast in a language that marks this sentence type distinction only by prosodic means, European Portuguese (EP). Using a modified version of the visual habituation paradigm, EP-learning infants at 5-6 and 8-9months were able to successfully discriminate segmentally varied, single-prosodic word intonational phrases presented with statement or yes-no question intonation, demonstrating that they are sensitive to the prosodic cues marking this distinction as early as 5months and maintain this sensitivity throughout the first year. These results suggest the presence of precocious discrimination abilities for intonation across segmental variation, similarly to previous reports for lexical pitch accent, but unlike previous findings for word stress.												52	62											MAR	2014	19	2					194	213		10.1111/infa.12037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12037												2026-01-16	WOS:000329924700005

The effect of the treatment on lexical tone was of particular interest. Four Cantonese speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease received treatment based on the principles of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). Outcome measures included perceptual measures and acoustic correlates of loudness, pitch, intonation, and tone (only intonation and tone are detailed in this study). All four participants demonstrated an increase in loudness, an increase in pitch and pitch range, and improved intonation during connected speech, as measured perceptually and acoustically. However, there were no obvious changes in the accuracy of lexical tone production, based on either phonetic transcription or acoustic analysis. The lack of improvement in lexical tones may support previous claims of a dissociation in fundamental frequency control for intonation and lexical tone production.												19	28											NOV-DEC	2007	21	11-12					919	925		10.1080/02699200701602045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699200701602045												2026-01-16	WOS:000251447800010

We investigated the relative efficiency of alaryngeal Cantonese speakers in conveying tonal variations in words in citation form. isolated tone tokens were produced by three esophageal speakers, two tracheoesophageal speakers, two pneumatic artificial laryngeal speakers, and two electrolaryngeal speakers for perceptual tests. The correct responses from 22 listeners were highest for the pneumatic artificial laryngeal speakers, and could be graded in order of proficiency as esophageal, tracheoesophageal, and electrolaryngeal speakers. These results provide a linguistic perspective tor guiding voice rehabilitation and the choice of voice in alaryngeal patients who speak a tone language.												27	29											JUN	1994	37	3					557	571		10.1044/jshr.3703.557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/jshr.3703.557												2026-01-16	WOS:A1994NP96500007
J	Zheng, XB; Ji, YL; Meng, XZ				Zheng, Xiaobei; Ji, Yinglin; Meng, Xiangzhi			Protracted Development on Native Tone Interpretation: Evidence From Mandarin-Learning Infants' Novel Word Learning	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Studies have shown that infants from cultures with tone languages develop categorical perception of their native lexical tone before their first birthday, but few studies have explored whether, and when, they interpret the phonemic function of lexical tone in word learning. Two habituation-switch experiments were conducted to explore whether Mandarin-learning infants could exploit tonal cues during their word learning, and detect a change when the association of two word-object pairs was switched. In Experiment 1, two words were solely differentiated by their lexical tones (fai/ vs. /fai/), and Mandarin-learning infants failed to detect the switch of tones at 14 months, but succeeded at 18 months. In Experiment 2, two words were markedly distinct (/fai/ vs. /bou/), and infants could detect the change of words as early as 14 months. The results indicate that infants may not refer to the lexical function of tone during their novel word learning until 18 months, even though infants from birth are able to distinguish the Tone 1 vs. Tone 3 contrast. Given that lexical tone is expressed by variations of the pitch contours, which are also related to intonation, infants' increasing knowledge of both tone and intonation may contribute to their misinterpretation of pitch contours in word learning at 14 months and, further, to their development of a sophisticated use of the phonemic function of lexical tone at 18 months of age.												0	0											JUL 5	2019	10								1512	10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01512	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01512												2026-01-16	WOS:000474204400001
J	Lu, S; Wayland, R; Kaan, E				Lu, Shuang; Wayland, Ratree; Kaan, Edith			Effects of production training and perception training on lexical tone perception - A behavioral and ERP study	BRAIN RESEARCH				Article								The present study recorded both behavioral data and event-related brain potentials to examine the effectiveness of a perception-only training and a perception-plus-production training procedure on the intentional and unintentional perception of lexical tone by native English listeners. In the behavioral task, both the perception-only and the perception-plus-production groups improved on the tone discrimination abilities after the training session. Moreover, the participants in both groups generalized the improvements gained through the trained stimuli to the untrained stimuli. In the ERP task, the Mismatch Negativity was smaller in the post-training task than in the pre-training task. However, the two training groups did not differ in tone processing at the intentional or unintentional level after training. These results suggest that the employment of the motor system does not specifically benefit the tone perceptual skills. Furthermore, the present study investigated whether some tone pairs are more easily confused than others by native English listeners, and whether the order of tone presentation influences non-native tone discrimination. In the behavioral task, Tone2-Tone1 (rising-level) and Tone2-Tone4 (rising-falling) were the most difficult tone pairs, while Tone1-Tone2 and Tone4-Tone2 were the easiest tone pairs, even though they involved the same tone contrasts respectively. In the ERP task, the native English listeners had good discrimination when Tone2 and Tone4 were embedded in strings of Tone1, while poor discrimination when Tone1 was inserted in the context of Tone2 or Tone4. These asymmetries in tone perception might be attributed to the interference of native intonation system and can be altered by training. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Liu, C				Liu, Chang			Just noticeable difference of tone pitch contour change for English- and Chinese-native listeners	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Just noticeable differences of tone pitch contour discrimination were examined for young English- and Mandarin Chinese-native listeners to examine categorical features of tone perception for the two groups of listeners. Three types of stimuli were used: A Mandarin Chinese vowel, an English vowel, and tonal glides. Level, rising, and falling tones within or across tone boundaries served as the standard stimuli to measure thresholds of tone pitch discrimination. Performance was equivalent between English-and Chinese-native listeners for level tones, but significantly differed for rising and falling tones, regardless of the type of stimuli. English listeners showed significantly lower thresholds at the offset of F0 shifts than Chinese listeners, while Chinese listeners discriminated tone pitch changes at the onset with significantly lower thresholds than their English peers. These psychophysical results, combined with tone perception reported in other studies, indicated that Mandarin-native listeners perceived lexical tones in a categorical manner, based on their lexical tone experience, whereas English-native listeners perceived tones on a psychophysical base.

J	Yuan, JH				Yuan, Jiahong			Perception of intonation in Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								There is a tendency across languages to use a rising pitch contour to convey question intonation and a falling pitch contour to convey a statement. In a lexical tone language such as Mandarin Chinese, rising and falling pitch contours are also used to differentiate lexical meaning. How, then, does the multiplexing of the F-0 channel affect the perception of question and statement intonation in a lexical tone language? This study investigated the effects of lexical tones and focus on the perception of intonation in Mandarin Chinese. The results show that lexical tones and focus impact the perception of sentence intonation. Question intonation was easier for native speakers to identify on a sentence with a final falling tone and more difficult to identify on a sentence with a final rising tone, suggesting that tone identification intervenes in the mapping of F-0 contours to intonational categories and that tone and intonation interact at the phonological level. In contrast, there is no evidence that the interaction between focus and intonation goes beyond the psychoacoustic level. The results provide insights that will be useful for further research on tone and intonation interactions in both acoustic modeling studies and neurobiological studies.

J	Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO				Liu, Min; Chen, Yiya; Schiller, Niels O.			Context Matters for Tone and Intonation Processing in Mandarin	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								In tonal languages such as Mandarin, both lexical tone and sentence intonation are primarily signaled by F0. Their F0 encodings are sometimes in conflict and sometimes in congruency. The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that top-down information provided by the semantically constraining context can play a facilitating role for listeners to disentangle intonational information from tonal information, but mainly in sentences with the lexical falling tone in the final position.												6	6											MAR	2022	65	1					52	72	0023830920986174	10.1177/0023830920986174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830920986174		JAN 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000618452600001

In German, for example, pitch is used to highlight focus, while in Vietnamese, different pitch contours distinguish lexical tones. As of yet, the interplay between intonation and lexical tone in relation to information structure has not been sufficiently investigated across languages. Vietnamese has six lexical tones and is particularly interesting for investigating the influence of different intonation strategies on the realization of tones. Here, we present a production study with 70 Northern Vietnamese speakers. The participants read six sentences under two conditions. In each sentence, a word occurring in the final position of the sentence and carrying one of the six tones was pronounced in two different discourse contexts. Acoustic analyses of the intonation contours showed that Vietnamese speakers realized the words with significant differences in pitch at the onset. Yet, the strategies for raising or lowering the pitch varied depending on the tone. Our results show the use of prosodic cues in a complex tone system across a large number of speakers. In addition, the study can serve as a starting point for educational programs that include training on intonation patterns in specific contexts.												0	0											JUN 17	2024	9								1411660	10.3389/feduc.2024.1411660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1411660												2026-01-16	WOS:001263992500001

A total of 172 Chinese children from third grade to sixth grade in Taiwanese primary schools were recruited. Thirty (14 male) children were identified as having dyslexia, and the remaining children (N = 142; 67 male) were typically developing children matched with those with dyslexia as carefully as possible with respect to school, grade, and gender. Our results indicated that group differences were found for all three types of prosodic sensitivity. Moderation analyses showed that group had no significant interaction with prosodic sensitivity in predicting Chinese reading, so the participants in the two groups were combined in the following analyses. The results of the stepwise regression analyses showed that only lexical tone awareness could significantly predict Chinese character reading after controlling for phonological awareness, while only intonation awareness could significantly predict reading comprehension after controlling for Chinese character reading. The results provide preliminary evidence on the issue of prosodic sensitivity in Chinese children with dyslexia and its role in Chinese reading, which might provide a novel approach to the teaching of Chinese languages.												6	6											AUG	2022	28	3					342	358		10.1002/dys.1720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dys.1720		JUL 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000820578800001
J	Ni, JF; Kawai, H; Hirose, K				Ni, JF; Kawai, H; Hirose, K			Constrained tone transformation technique for separation and combination of Mandarin tone and intonation	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This paper addresses a classical but important problem: The coupling of lexical tones and sentence intonation in tonal languages, such as Chinese, focusing particularly on voice fundamental frequency (F-0) contours of speech. It is important because it forms the basis of speech synthesis technology and prosody analysis. We provide a solution to the problem with a constrained tone transformation technique based on structural modeling of the F-0 contours. This consists of transforming target values in pairs from norms to variants. These targets are intended to sparsely specify the prosodic contributions to the F0 contours, while the alignment of target pairs between norms and variants is based on underlying lexical tone structures. When the norms take the citation forms of lexical tones, the technique makes it possible to separate sentence intonation from observed F0 contours. When the norms take normative F0 contours, it is possible to measure intonation variations from the norms to the variants, both having identical lexical tone structures. This paper explains the underlying scientific and linguistic principles and presents an algorithm that was implemented on computers. The method's capability of separating and combining tone and intonation is evaluated through analysis and re-synthesis of several hundred observed F0 contours.

J	Gussenhoven, C; van de Ven, M				Gussenhoven, Carlos; van de Ven, Marco			Categorical perception of lexical tone contrasts and gradient perception of the statement-question intonation contrast in Zhumadian Mandarin	LANGUAGE AND COGNITION				Article								We intended to establish if two lexical tone contrasts in Zhumadian Mandarin, one between early and late aligned falls and another between early and late aligned rises, are perceived categorically, while the difference between declarative and interrogative pronunciations of these four tones is perceived gradiently. Presenting stimuli from 7-point acoustic continua between tones and between intonations, we used an identification task and a discrimination task with an experimental group of native listeners and a control group of Indonesian listeners, whose language employs none of the differences within either the falling or the rising pitch contours in its phonology. Only the lexical condition as perceived by the experimental group yielded sigmoid identification functions and a heightened discriminatory sensitivity around the midpoint of continua. The intonational condition in the native group and both conditions in the control group yielded gradient identification functions and smaller, reverse effects of the continuum midpoints in the discrimination task. The results are interpreted to mean that sentence modality contrasts can be expressed gradiently, but that lexical tone differences are represented phonologically, and hence are perceived categorically, despite low phonetic salience of the contrast. This conclusion challenges assumptions about the relation between linguistic functions and linguistic structures.												7	8											DEC	2020	12	4					614	648		10.1017/langcog.2020.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2020.14												2026-01-16	WOS:000589092300002
J	Gussenhoven, C; van den Beuken, F				Gussenhoven, Carlos; van den Beuken, Frank			Contrasting the high rise and the low rise intonations in a dialect with the Central Franconian tone	LINGUISTIC REVIEW				Article								The dialect of Helden (Netherlands) maintains intonational contrasts between the fall, the fall-rise, the low rise and the high rise, while also having a binary lexical tone contrast in (accented or unaccented) final syllables in the IP as well as in accented IP-internal syllables. The lexical tone contrast, which is an instance of the Central Franconian tone contrast known as Accent 1 vs Accent 2, appears in the stressed syllable of words, and so competes with the contour differences that are due to the intonational contrasts. In general, the Helden lexical contrasts fall within the phonetic variation that is available for the Standard Dutch intonation contours. The dialect maintains these multiple contrasts (a) by different timings of the falling movement in the fall and the fall-rise, which is later for Accent 2; (b) by different timings of the rising movement in the low rise, which is later for Accent 2; (c) by a lowered realization of the first H-tone after the lexical tone in the post-focal contour of the low rise and the high rise, and (d) by making IP-final rimes with Accent 2 longer than those with Accent 1.												3	3											MAR	2012	29	1					75	107		10.1515/tlr-2012-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/tlr-2012-0004												2026-01-16	WOS:000314226600004

J	Singh, L; Chee, M				Singh, Leher; Chee, Melissa			Rise and fall: Effects of tone and intonation on spoken word recognition in early childhood	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								A crucial component of word learning is the ability to recognize words in spite of the varying forms they assume. This may be particularly challenging in tone languages as learners have to develop tone representations in the face of intonational variation in order to accurately recognize words. The effects of intonational variation on word recognition of tone-marked words in Mandarin Chinese were investigated in toddlers and preschoolers using a cross-sectional design. Participants were presented with known words where intonation (question/statement) and tone (rising/falling) were independently manipulated. Results demonstrated that word recognition in toddlers was heavily influenced by changes in the pitch contour of a tone due to intonational variation. In contrast, preschool were able to recognize tone-marked words regardless of simultaneous intonational variation, demonstrating a comparatively robust representation of lexical tone. Results chart an evolution in integrating pitch cues to tone and intonation over the first few years of life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ma, JKY; Ciocca, V; Whitehill, TL				Ma, Joan K-Y; Ciocca, Valter; Whitehill, Tara L.			The perception of intonation questions and statements in Cantonese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								In tone languages there are potential conflicts in the perception of lexical tone and intonation, as both depend mainly on the differences in fundamental frequency (F0) patterns. The present study investigated the acoustic cues associated with the perception of sentences as questions or statements in Cantonese, as a function of the lexical tone in sentence final position. Cantonese listeners performed intonation identification tasks involving complete sentences, isolated final syllables, and sentences without the final syllable (carriers). Sensitivity (d' scores) were similar for complete sentences and final syllables but were significantly lower for carriers. Sensitivity was also affected by tone identity. These findings show that the perception of questions and statements relies primarily on the F0 characteristics of the final syllables (local F0 cues). A measure of response bias (c) provided evidence for a general bias toward the perception of statements. Logistic regression analyses showed that utterances were accurately classified as questions or statements by using average F0 and F0 interval. Average F0 of carriers (global F0 cue) was also found to be a reliable secondary cue. These findings suggest that the use of F0 cues for the perception of intonation question in tonal languages is likely to be language-specific. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

Acoustic analysis of lexical tone in Mandarin infant-directed speech	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Using Mandarin Chinese, a "tone language" in which the pitch contours of syllables differentiate words, the authors examined the acoustic modifications of infant-directed speech (IDS) at the syllable level to test 2 hypotheses: (a) the overall increase in pitch and intonation contour that occurs in IDS at the phrase level would not distort lexical pitch at the syllable level and (b) IDS provides exaggerates cues to lexical tones. Sixteen Mandarin-speaking mothers were recorded while addressing their infants and addressing an adult. The results indicate that IDS does not distort the acoustic cues that are essential to word meaning at the syllable level; evidence of exaggeration of the acoustic differences in IDS was observed, extending previous findings of phonetic exaggeration to the lexical level.												64	85											JUL	2007	43	4					912	917		10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.912												2026-01-16	WOS:000247839400009

Therefore, native tone language alaryngeal speakers encountering difficulty imparting lexical tone variation would suffer loss of speech intelligibility. This study examines the intelligibility of lexical tone produced by four different alaryngeal speech methods, namely: oesophageal speech, electrolarynx, a pneumatic device and tracheo-oesophageal speech. Isolated and embedded monosyllabic Chinese words produced by 53 alaryngeal speakers were presented to three normally hearing young adult listeners with no prior exposure to laryngectomy speech. The listeners transcribed the speech orthographically. Significant differences were found in the intelligibility level between the different speech methods. Listeners' responses were also pooled together and analysed for tone and segmental errors. Errors of tone alone were found to occur more often than segmental errors.												19	23												1994	29	4					339	347															2026-01-16	WOS:A1994PX60600003
J	Ota, M; Yamane, N; Mazuka, R				Ota, Mitsuhiko; Yamane, Naoto; Mazuka, Reiko			The Effects of Lexical Pitch Accent on Infant Word Recognition in Japanese	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Learners of lexical tone languages (e.g., Mandarin) develop sensitivity to tonal contrasts and recognize pitch-matched, but not pitch-mismatched, familiar words by 11 months. Learners of non-tone languages (e.g., English) also show a tendency to treat pitch patterns as lexically contrastive up to about 18 months. In this study, we examined if this early-developing capacity to lexically encode pitch variations enables infants to acquire a pitch accent system, in which pitch-based lexical contrasts are obscured by the interaction of lexical and non-lexical (i.e., intonational) features. Eighteen 17-month-olds learning Tokyo Japanese were tested on their recognition of familiar words with the expected pitch or the lexically opposite pitch pattern. In early trials, infants were faster in shifting their eyegaze from the distractor object to the target object than in shifting from the target to distractor in the pitch-matched condition. In later trials, however, infants showed faster distractor-to-target than target-to-distractor shifts in both the pitch-matched and pitch-mismatched conditions. We interpret these results to mean that, in a pitch-accent system, the ability to use pitch variations to recognize words is still in a nascent state at 17 months.												4	4											JAN 12	2018	8								2354	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02354	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02354												2026-01-16	WOS:000419922400001
J	Gussenhoven, C				Gussenhoven, Carlos			Asymmetries in the intonation system of the tonal dialect of Maastricht Limburgish	PHONOLOGY				Article								The lexical tone and intonation contrasts in the Limburgish dialect of Maastricht are remarkable in a number of ways. While a falling pitch contour on an IP-medial syllable signals a non-declarative intonation, on an IP-final syllable it signals a declarative intonation. In addition, although there is a binary tone contrast (Accent 1 vs. Accent 2) and four nuclear intonation contours, only three intonation contours exist for nuclear syllables with Accent 2, while in IP-final position only two intonation contours exist for nuclear syllables with Accent 1, so that the full set of four intonation contours is only observable in IP-medial nuclear syllables with Accent 1. The context-dependent function of the pitch fall and the asymmetries are explained by a grammar in which the OCP is enforced absolutely, and the number of tones per syllable is restricted to two, unless the three tones each represent a different morpheme: OCP, REALISEMORPH >>#TTT.												5	5												2012	29	1					39	79		10.1017/S0952675712000036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952675712000036												2026-01-16	WOS:000302908300002
J	Schaefer, V; Darcy, I				Schaefer, Vance; Darcy, Isabelle			Lexical function of pitch in the first language shapes cross-linguistic perception of Thai tones	LABORATORY PHONOLOGY				Article								Determining the factors involved in the non-native perception of the pitch patterns of tones is complicated by the fact that all languages use pitch to various extents, whether linguistic (e.g., intonation) or non-linguistic (e.g., singing). Moreover, many languages use pitch to distinguish lexical items with varying degrees of functional load and differences in inventory of such pitch patterns. The current study attempts to understand what factors determine accurate naive (= non-learner) perception of non-native tones, in order to establish the baseline for acquisition of a tonal L2. We examine the perception of Thai tones (i.e., three level tones, two contour tones) by speakers of languages on a spectrum of lexically contrastive pitch usage: Mandarin (lexical tone), Japanese (lexical pitch accent), English (lexical stress), and Korean (no lexically contrastive pitch). Results suggest that the importance of lexically contrastive pitch in the L1 influences non-native tone perception so that not all non-tonal language speakers possess the same level of tonal sensitivity, resulting in a hierarchy of perceptual accuracy. Referencing the Feature Hypothesis (McAllister et al. 2002), we propose the Functional Pitch Hypothesis to model our findings: the degree to which linguistic pitch differentiates lexical items in the L1 shapes the naive perception of a non-native lexically contrastive pitch system, e.g., tones.												29	40											NOV	2014	5	4					489	522		10.1515/lp-2014-0016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/lp-2014-0016												2026-01-16	WOS:000365703800003

Lexical tone, the linguistically structured and dynamic aspects of F0, has received much less research attention. A main methodological issue lies on how tonal F0 should be parameterized for the best speaker discrimination performance. This paper compares the speaker discriminatory performance of three approaches with lexical tone modeling: discrete cosine transform (DCT), polynomial curve fitting, and quantitative target approximation (qTA). Results show that using parameters based on DCT and polynomials led to similarly promising performance, whereas those based on qTA generally yielded relatively poor performance. Implications modeling surface tonal F0 and the underlying articulatory processes for speaker discrimination are discussed.												1	1											MAR	2025	68	1					229	243		10.1177/00238309241261702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00238309241261702		JUL 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001278062100001

Participants were tested on their discrimination of Mandarin Chinese lexical tones, Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), and Musical Ear Test (MET). The Chinese listeners outperformed the Dutch listeners on both MBEA and MET, but had comparable accuracies for the lexical tone discrimination. Importantly, a significant cross-domain correlation was only observed for the Dutch listeners but not for the Chinese listeners. For tone language listeners, once lexical tones have been acquired, native listeners perceive them as phonological categories, and split them from other pitch variations that do not play a phonemic role. Non-tone language listeners, on the other hand, perceive both lexical tones and musical pitch on a psycho-acoustical basis, hence exhibit a unified perception of pitch across the two domains.												44	47												2016	31	6					751	760		10.1080/23273798.2016.1156715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2016.1156715												2026-01-16	WOS:000377776900004
J	Zhang, YX; Schmidt, E; Post, B				Zhang, Yixin; Schmidt, Elaine; Post, Brechtje			Perception of Intonation on Neutral Tone in Mandarin	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION				Article								In Mandarin, lexical tone has been found to interact with intonational tone to influence intonation perception, with the falling T4 facilitating the perception of the statement/question contrast the most, and the rising T2 the least. However, in addition to the four citation tones T1-T4, Mandarin has "neutral tone" which marks weak, non-initial syllables that do not carry a citation tone. The prevailing view is that neutral tone is, in fact, phonologically toneless. It is unknown whether neutral tone can also affect intonation perception. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that if neutral tone is indeed toneless, it cannot interact with intonational tone in the same way as citation tones do. We investigated this novel hypothesis with a perception experiment in which 22 Mandarin speakers had to determine whether disyllabic citation tone and neutral tone words were a question or statement. Results show that the identification of intonation contours is more accurate for neutral tone than for T2, and similarly accurate for neutral tone and T4, regardless of whether the neutral tone is intrinsic or derived. Furthermore, both T4 and neutral tone are realized with a reduced pitch range at a higher pitch level in questions, unlike T2, which is characterized by a slightly expanded pitch range and a higher pitch level. It is possible that intonation perception in Mandarin is facilitated by changes in the phonetic shapes of lexical tones brought by intonation rather than the phonological interaction between lexical tones and intonation. The importance of pitch changes to the intonation perception in Mandarin was further tested in a second perception experiment with the same 22 participants and disyllabic stimuli with manipulated pitch level and range. Results indicate that the use of pitch cues in intonation perception shows tone-specific differences, namely, pitch range is more important in signaling the question/statement contrast in utterances ending with T4 or neutral tone, while pitch level is the only perceptual cue to interrogativity for utterances ending in T2.												2	2											JUN 27	2022	7								849132	10.3389/fcomm.2022.849132	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2022.849132												2026-01-16	WOS:000822933300001
J	Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO				Liu, Min; Chen, Yiya; Schiller, Niels O.			Online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin: Evidence from ERPs	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin at the attentive stage. We examined the behavioral and electrophysiological responses of native Mandarin listeners to Mandarin sentences, which contrast in final tones (rising Tone2 or falling Tone4) and intonations (Question or Statement). A clear P300 effect was observed for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone4, but no ERP effect was found for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone2. Our results provide ERP evidence for the interaction of tone and intonation in Mandarin, confirming the findings with behavioral metalinguistic data that native Mandarin listeners can distinguish between question intonation and statement intonation when the intonation is associated with a final Tone4, but fail to do so when the intonation is associated with a final Tone2. Our study extended the understanding of online processing of tone and intonation (1) from the pre-attentive stage to the attentive stage and (2) within a larger domain (i.e. multi-word utterances) than a single word utterance.

A deficit in music pitch processing as manifested in the condition of congenital amusia has been related to difficulties in lexical tone processing for both tone and non-tonal languages. However, it is still unclear whether amusia also affects the perception of vowel phonemes in quiet and in noise. In this study, we examined vowel-plustone identification in quiet and noise conditions among Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without speech tone difficulties (tone agnosics and pure amusics, respectively), and IQ- and age-matched controls. Overall, pure amusics showed vowel and tone identification comparable to the controls in both quiet and noise conditions. Compared to pure amusics and controls, tone agnosics showed deficits in tone perception in both quiet and noise conditions. More importantly, their vowel perception was lower than pure amusics and controls in noise conditions, e.g., at a signal-to-noise ratio of -4 dB, although they showed normal-like performance in quiet and at a signal-to-noise ratio of -8 dB. These results suggest that when amusia affected speech tone processing (e.g., tone agnosics), it could also compromise vowel processing in noise. However, amusia alone does not affect tone or vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese either in quiet or in noise. Overall, the current study highlights the necessity of taking heterogeneity within the amusic group into account when considering the related speech deficits in this group. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims at better clarifying the involvement of different linguistic subdomains in this cross-domain link, assessing whether or not musicality and music expertise enhance phonological and lexical tone processing of Mandarin Chinese. In two experiments different groups of adults and children with no previous experience in tonal languages, were invited to perform a same-different task trying to detect phonological and tonal variations in pairs of sequences of monosyllabic Mandarin Chinese words. Main results show that all subjects perform significantly better in detecting phonological variations rather than tonal ones. They also show that both melodic proficiency and music expertise are good predictors for a better tonal, but not phonological identification. Data lead to a model of music-to-language transfer effect in which musicality selectively affects linguistic intonation while leaving phonological processing substantially unaffected.												82	94												2010	22	1					46	61		10.1080/09541440802708136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09541440802708136												2026-01-16	WOS:000274915800004

CATEGORIZING MANDARIN TONES INTO LISTENERS' NATIVE PROSODIC CATEGORIES: THE ROLE OF PHONETIC PROPERTIES	POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS				Article								This study examined whether native speakers of non-tone languages (Australian English, and French) were able to perceive foreign Mandarin tones in a sentence environment according to their native prosodic categories. Results found that both English and French speakers were able to perceptually categorize foreign tones into their intonational categories (i-Categories), and that categorizations were based on the contextual phonetic similarities of the pitch contours they perceived between Mandarin tones and their native i-Categories. Results also showed that French speakers, but not English speakers, were able to detect the fine-detailed phonetic feature differences between Tone 3 and Tone 4 (low/falling tone vs. high-falling tone). The findings support a new extension of the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM; Best 1995) to suprasegmental phonology (So and Best 2008): that non-native prosodic categories (e. g. lexical tones) will be assimilated to the categories of listeners' native prosodic system (e. g. intonation). In addition, rhythmic differences among languages may also contribute to perception of non-native tones.												21	25											MAR	2011	47	1			SI		133	145		10.2478/psicl-2011-0011	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/psicl-2011-0011												2026-01-16	WOS:000292128200011
J	Karlsson, A; House, D; Svantesson, JO				Karlsson, Anastasia; House, David; Svantesson, Jan-Olof			Intonation Adapts to Lexical Tone: The Case of Kammu	PHONETICA				Article								In this paper, we investigate how lexical tones interact with intonation, using data from the Austroasiatic language Kammu, one of few languages with two dialects whose only major phonological difference is the presence or absence of lexical tones. Northern (and Western) Kammu have developed tones in connection with the merger of voiceless and voiced initial consonants, while the non-tonal Eastern dialect kept the segmental opposition with no tones. We found the following prosodic hierarchy: (1) lexical tones, (2) phrase-final boundary tone, (3) focus marking. The results strongly suggest that the intonational systems of the two Kammu dialects are basically identical, and that the main differences between the dialects are adaptations of intonation patterns to the lexical tones when the identities of the tones are jeopardized.

While these interactions are established for semantic and syntactic processes, the functional network of speech intonation - the linguistic variation of pitch - has been scarcely defined. Particularly little is known about intonation in tonal languages, in which pitch not only serves intonation but also expresses meaning via lexical tones. The present study used psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterise the neural networks underlying intonation and tone processing in native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Participants categorised either intonation or tone of monosyllabic Mandarin words that gradually varied between statement and question and between Tone 2 and Tone 4. Intonation processing induced bilateral fronto-temporal activity and increased functional connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal regions, likely linking auditory perception and labelling of intonation categories in a phonological network. Tone processing induced bilateral temporal activity, associated with the auditory representation of tonal (phonemic) categories. Together, the present data demonstrate the breadth of the functional intonation network in a tonal language including higher-level phonological processes in addition to auditory representations common to both intonation and tone.												10	11											JAN	2021	42	1					161	174		10.1002/hbm.25214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25214		SEP 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000573645300001

Tone language learning infants (Experiment 1, Mandarin monolingual; Experiment 2, Mandarin-English bilingual) were tested with Mandarin (native) or Thai (non-native) lexical tone pairs which contrasted static vs. dynamic (high vs. rising) tones or dynamic vs. dynamic (rising vs. falling) tones. Non-tone language, English-learning infants (Experiment 3) were tested on English intonational contrasts or the Mandarin or Thai tone contrasts. Monolingual Mandarin language infants were able to bind tones to novel words for the Mandarin High-Rising contrast, but not for the Mandarin Rising-Falling contrast; and they were insensitive to both the High-Rising and the Rising-Falling tone contrasts in Thai. Bilingual English-Mandarin infants were similar to the Mandarin monolinguals in that they were sensitive to the Mandarin High-Rising contrast and not to the Mandarin Rising-Falling contrast. However, unlike the Mandarin monolinguals, they were also sensitive to the High Rising contrast in Thai. Monolingual English learning infants were insensitive to all three types of contrasts (Mandarin, Thai, English), although they did respond differentially to tone-bearing vs. intonation-marked words. Findings suggest that infants' sensitivity to tones in word learning contexts depends heavily on tone properties, and that this influence is, in some cases, stronger than effects of language familiarity. Moreover, bilingual infants demonstrated greater phonological flexibility in tone interpretation.												24	25											JAN 4	2018	8								2190	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02190	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02190												2026-01-16	WOS:000419399000002

Method: Lexical-tone recognition was assessed in pediatric CI recipients and listeners with normal hearing (NH) in 2 tasks. In Task 1, participants identified naturally uttered words that were contrastive in lexical tones. For Task 2, a disyllabic word (yanjing) was manipulated orthogonally, varying in fundamental-frequency (F0) contours and duration patterns. Participants identified each token with the second syllable jing pronounced with Tone 1 (a high level tone) as eyes or with Tone 4 (a high falling tone) as eyeglasses. Results: CI participants' recognition accuracy was significantly lower than NH listeners' in Task 1. In Task 2, CI participants' reliance on F0 contours was significantly less than that of NH listeners; their reliance on duration patterns, however, was significantly higher than that of NH listeners. Both CI and NH listeners' performance in Task 1 was significantly correlated with their reliance on F0 contours in Task 2. Conclusion: For pediatric CI recipients, lexical-tone recognition using naturally uttered words is primarily related to their reliance on F0 contours, although duration patterns may be used as an additional cue.												45	49											MAY	2017	60	5					1223	1235		10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0048												2026-01-16	WOS:000402754000004

Currently, there is still a lack of understanding of sensitivity to F0 change in CI users who speak tonal languages. In the present study, just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of F0 contour and F0 level changes in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs were measured and compared with those in their age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Results showed that children with CIs demonstrated significantly larger JND of F0 contour (JND-C) change and F0 level (JND-L) change compared to NH children. Further within-group comparison revealed that the JND-C change was significantly smaller than the JND-L change among children with CIs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among NH children. No significant correlations were seen between JND-C change/JND-L change and age at implantation /duration of CI use. The contrast between children with CIs and NH children in sensitivity to F0 contour and F0 level change suggests different mechanisms of F0 processing in these two groups as a result of different hearing experiences.												3	4											APR	2022	12	4							443	10.3390/brainsci12040443	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12040443												2026-01-16	WOS:000785521700001

While the samples' heterogeneous cognitive abilities may be contributing factors, the phenotype of tone and intonation processing in autism may also vary with one's language background. Thirty-eight cognitively able autistic and 32 non-autistic Mandarin-speaking children completed tone and intonation perception tasks, each containing a function and form condition. Results suggested that the abilities to discriminate tone and intonation were not impaired at either the form or function level in these autistic children, and that these abilities were positively associated with one another in both autistic and non-autistic groups. The more severe the autism symptoms, the worse the form- and function-level of tone and intonation processing. While enhanced tone and intonation processing has been found in a subgroup of autistic children, it may not be a general characteristic of the autistic population with long-term tone language experience. These findings reveal typical tone and intonation processing at both the form and function levels in cognitively able Mandarin-speaking autistic children and provide evidence for associated tone and intonation processing abilities across levels.												5	5											JUL	2023	154	1					467	481		10.1121/10.0020271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0020271												2026-01-16	WOS:001036228000003

Regarding segmental phonology, as well as lexical suprasegmentals (lexical tone and stress), both the use of two levels of representation and the existence of an international phonetic alphabet have proved to be very useful.

The relative weight of each of these means varies cross-linguistically. In this paper, we look at the role of intonation in the realization of communicative functions in Northern Vietnamese, a language with a complex lexical tone system. Our results, which are based on systematically controlled data, show that there are a number of acoustic strategies for realizing communicative functions, predominantly based on global f0 and intensity and local sentence-final f0. These strategies are subject to a great degree of speaker variation, although this variation appears to be consistent with intonational universals as reflected in biological codes.												11	14											MAR	2012	29	1					3	36		10.1515/tlr-2012-0002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/tlr-2012-0002												2026-01-16	WOS:000314226600002

Method: Thirteen pure amusics (i.e., amusics with normal lexical processing), 5 tone agnosics (i.e., with lexical tone deficit), and 12 controls were screened with Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia and lexical tone tests (Nan et al., 2010; Peretz et al., 2003). Vowel-plus-tone identification tasks with the factors of vowel type and syllables with and without semantic content (e.g., real and nonsense words) were examined among the 3 groups, and identification scores were calculated in 3 formats: vowel-plus-tone identification, vowel identification, and tone identification. Results: Tone agnosics showed significantly poorer performances on identifications of vowel, tone, and vowel plus tone across monophthongs, diphthongs, and triphthongs in both real and nonsense words compared to pure amusics and controls. Their deficits were similar across the 3 types of vowels, while the deficit on vowel-plus-tone identification was more severe in nonsense words than in real words. On the other hand, pure amusics performed similarly with controls across all these conditions. Conclusions: Tone agnosia might affect both musical pitch and phonological processing, resulting in deficits in lexical tone and vowel perception. On the contrary, pure amusics's effect is primarily on musical pitch perception but not on lexical tone or phonemic deficit. Vowel type did not affect speech deficits for tone agnosics, while they relied more on semantic content as a compensation.												4	4											DEC	2019	62	12					4300	4308		10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-18-0440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-18-0440												2026-01-16	WOS:000561769300006

Methods: Lexical tones were recorded from CI recipients and their peers with normal hearing (NH). Each participant was asked to produce a disyllabic word, yan jing, with which the first syllable was pronounced as Tone 3 (a low dipping tone) while the second syllable was pronounced as Tone 1 (a high level tone, meaning "eyes") or as Tone 4 (a high falling tone, meaning "eyeglasses"). In addition, a parametric manipulation in fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of Tones 1 and 4 used in a lexical tone recognition task in Peng et al. (2017) was adopted to evaluate the perceptual reliance on each dimension. Results: Mixed-effect analyses of duration, intensity, and F0 cues revealed that NH children focused exclusively on marking distinct F0 contours, while CI participants shortened Tone 4 or prolonged Tone 1 to enhance their contrast. In line with these production strategies, NH children relied primarily on F0 cues to identify the two tones, whereas CI children showed greater reliance on duration cues. Moreover, CI participants who placed greater perceptual weight on duration cues also tended to exhibit smaller changes in their F0 production. Conclusion: Pediatric CI recipients appear to contrast the secondary acoustic dimension (duration) in addition to F0 contours for both lexical tone production and perception. These findings suggest that perception and production strategies of lexical tones are well coupled in this pediatric CI population.												22	24											JUN 20	2019	13								639	10.3389/fnins.2019.00639	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00639												2026-01-16	WOS:000472227600001

Developmental change in tone perception in Mandarin monolingual, English monolingual, and Mandarin-English bilingual infants: Divergences between monolingual and bilingual learners	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Most languages use lexical tone to discriminate the meanings of words. There has been recent interest in tracking the development of tone categories during infancy. These studies have focused largely on monolingual infants learning either a tone language or a non-tone language. It remains to be seen how bilingual infants learning one tone language (e.g., Mandarin) and one non-tone language (e.g., English) discriminate tones. Here, we examined infants' discrimination of two Mandarin tones pairs: one salient and one subtle. Discrimination was investigated in three groups: Mandarin-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and Mandarin monolinguals at 6 months and 9 months of age in a cross-sectional design. Results demonstrated relatively strong Mandarin tone discrimination in Mandarin monolinguals, with salient tone discrimination at 6 months and both salient and subtle tone discrimination at 9 months. English monolinguals discriminated neither contrast at 6 months but discriminated the salient contrast at 9 months. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for tone discrimination in Mandarin-English bilingual infants. In a second experiment, 12- and 13-month-old Mandarin-English bilingual and English monolingual infants were tested to determine whether bilinguals would demonstrate tone sensitivity at a later age. Results revealed a lack of tone sensitivity at 12 or 13 months in bilingual infants, yet English monolingual infants were sensitive to both salient and subtle Mandarin tone contrasts at 12 or 13 months. Our findings provide evidence for age-related convergence in Mandarin tone discrimination in English and Mandarin monolingual infants and for a distinct pattern of tone discrimination in bilingual infants. Theoretical implications for phonetic category acquisition are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The two word tone patterns are realised in a variety of different ways, depending on the intonation contour, on whether the word has a focus tone, and on whether it occurs finally or nonfinally in the intonational phrase (IP). Twelve such contexts are identified, and an autosegmental-metrical analysis is presented of the contours for the word tones in each of these. The analysis is instructive because of its clear illustration of the distinction between the phonological underlying representation and the phonological surface representation, as well as of the distinction between the latter representation and the phonetic realisation. In addition, because of the complexity of its tonal phonology, the dialect is of considerable typological interest for the study of word prosody and intonation.												43	47											MAR	1999	35	1					99	135		10.1017/S0022226798007324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022226798007324												2026-01-16	WOS:000080648200004
J	Bordal, G				Bordal, Guri			Central African French: lexical tone French	REVUE FRANCAISE DE LINGUISTIQUE APPLIQUEE				Article								In this article, I present the tonal system of Central African French (CAF), which is the variety of French spoken in Bangui in the Central African Republic. The study is based on a corpus of recordings of spontaneous speech produced by twelve multilingual speakers, using mainly the African language Sango and French in their every-day communication. I show that the tonal system of CAF is to a great extent influenced by the phonological system of Sango.												4	4											DEC	2013	18	2					91	102															2026-01-16	WOS:000327365400008

Studies of Chinese Speakers with Dysarthria: Informing Theoretical Models	FOLIA PHONIATRICA ET LOGOPAEDICA				Review								Most theoretical models of dysarthria have been developed based on research using individuals speaking English or other Indo-European languages. Studies of individuals with dysarthria speaking other languages can allow investigation into the universality of such models, and the interplay between language-specific and language-universal aspects of dysarthria. In this article, studies of Cantonese-and Mandarin-Chinese speakers with dysarthria are reviewed. The studies focused on 2 groups of speakers: those with cerebral palsy and those with Parkinson's disease. Key findings are compared with similar studies of English speakers. Since Chinese is tonal in nature, the impact of dysarthria on lexical tone has received considerable attention in the literature. The relationship between tone [which involves fundamental frequency (F-0) control at the syllable level] and intonation (involving F-0 control at the sentential level) has received more recent attention. Many findings for Chinese speakers with dysarthria support earlier findings for English speakers, thus affirming the language-universal aspect of dysarthria. However, certain differences, which can be attributed to the distinct phonologies of Cantonese and Mandarin, highlight the language-specific aspects of the condition. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

J	Arnold, L				Arnold, Laura			Lexical Tone in Metnyo Ambel	OCEANIC LINGUISTICS				Article								In this paper, I outline the tone system of the Metnyo dialect of Ambel, an endangered Austronesian language spoken in the Raja Ampat archipelago in east Indonesia. The tone system of Metnyo Ambel is binary and privative: /H/ syllables contrast with toneless syllables. I will present data from monosyllabic and polysyllabic words, as well as words of varying morphological complexity, to show that tone is culminative, both at the level of the morpheme and in the output, but not obligatory. The realization of tone will also be described. In particular, I focus on the pitch patterns found on intonation phrase-final syllables, which depend on a complex interaction between lexical tone, intonational boundary tones (whether the word is lexical or grammatical), and the moraic weight of the syllable. Finally, the tone system of Metnyo Ambel will be compared with the prosodic systems of other nearby languages, including the closely related Maya and Matbat.												3	5											JUN	2018	57	1					199	220		10.1353/ol.2018.0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/ol.2018.0007												2026-01-16	WOS:000433228300008

Intonation Contrast in Cantonese Speakers With Hypokinetic Dysarthria Associated With Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Speech produced by individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a number of features including impaired speech prosody. The purpose of this study was to investigate intonation contrasts produced by this group of speakers. Method: Speech materials with a question-statement contrast were collected from 14 Cantonese speakers with PD. Twenty listeners then classified the productions as either questions or statements. Acoustic analyses of F0, duration, and intensity were conducted to determine which acoustic cues distinguished the production of questions from statements, and which cues appeared to be exploited by listeners in identifying intonational contrasts. Results: The results show that listeners identified statements with a high degree of accuracy, but the accuracy of question identification ranged from 0.56% to 96% across the 14 speakers. The speakers with PD used similar acoustic cues as nondysarthric Cantonese speakers to mark the question-statement contrast, although the contrasts were not observed in all speakers. Listeners mainly used F0 cues at the final syllable for intonation identification. Conclusion: These data contribute to the researchers' understanding of intonation marking in speakers with PD, with specific application to the production and perception of intonation in a lexical tone language.												27	36											AUG 1	2010	53	4					836	849		10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0216)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0216)												2026-01-16	WOS:000280598100003
J	Chan, RKW				Chan, Ricky K. W.			Speaker variability in the realisation of lexical tones	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND THE LAW				Article								While previous studies on the speaker-discriminatory power of static f0 parameters abound, few have focused on the dynamic and linguistically structured aspects of f0. Lexical tone offers a case in point for this endeavour. This article reports an exploratory study on the speaker-discriminatory power of individual lexical tones and of the height relationship of level tone pairs in Cantonese, and the effects of voice level and linguistic condition on their realisation. Twenty native Cantonese speakers produced systematically controlled words either in isolation or in a carrier sentence under two voice levels (normal and loud). Results show that f0 height and f0 dynamics are separate dimensions of a tone and are affected by voice level and linguistic condition in different ways. Moreover, discriminant analyses reveal that the contours of individual tones and the height differences of level tone pairs are useful parameters for characterising speakers.												4	4												2016	23	2					195	214		10.1558/ijsll.v23i2.30908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1558/ijsll.v23i2.30908												2026-01-16	WOS:000392866900002
J	Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D				Chien, Pei-Ju; Friederici, Angela D.; Hartwigsen, Gesa; Sammler, Daniela			Neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non-tonal language speakers	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING				Article								Intonation, the modulation of pitch in speech, is a crucial aspect of language that is processed in right-hemispheric regions, beyond the classical left-hemispheric language system. Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.												27	28											MAY	2020	41	7					1842	1858		10.1002/hbm.24916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24916		JAN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000508026600001

How Tone, Intonation and Emotion Shape the Development of Infants' Fundamental Frequency Perception	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Review								Fundamental frequency (integral(0)), perceived as pitch, is the first and arguably most salient auditory component humans are exposed to since the beginning of life. It carries multiple linguistic (e.g., word meaning) and paralinguistic (e.g., speakers' emotion) functions in speech and communication. The mappings between these functions and integral(0) features vary within a language and differ cross-linguistically. For instance, a rising pitch can be perceived as a question in English but a lexical tone in Mandarin. Such variations mean that infants must learn the specific mappings based on their respective linguistic and social environments. To date, canonical theoretical frameworks and most empirical studies do not view or consider the multi-functionality of integral(0), but typically focus on individual functions. More importantly, despite the eventual mastery of integral(0) in communication, it is unclear how infants learn to decompose and recognize these overlapping functions carried by integral(0). In this paper, we review the symbioses and synergies of the lexical, intonational, and emotional functions that can be carried by integral(0) and are being acquired throughout infancy. On the basis of our review, we put forward the Learnability Hypothesis that infants decompose and acquire multiple integral(0) functions through native/environmental experiences. Under this hypothesis, we propose representative cases such as the synergy scenario, where infants use visual cues to disambiguate and decompose the different integral(0) functions. Further, viable ways to test the scenarios derived from this hypothesis are suggested across auditory and visual modalities. Discovering how infants learn to master the diverse functions carried by integral(0) can increase our understanding of linguistic systems, auditory processing and communication functions.												9	11											JUN 3	2022	13								906848	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906848	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906848												2026-01-16	WOS:000812838400001

Like in other languages, ISQs and RQs in Standard Chinese can have the same surface structure, allowing for a direct prosodic comparison between illocution types (ISQ vs RQ). Since Standard Chinese has lexical tone, the use of f0 as a cue to illocution type may be restricted. We inves-tigate the prosodic differences between ISQs and RQs as well as the interplay of prosodic cues to RQs. In terms of f0, results showed that RQs were lower in f0, with the f0 range on the first word being expanded followed by f0 compression. RQs were further longer in duration and more often realized with non-modal voice quality (glottalized voice) as compared to ISQs. These prosodic cues were largely manipulated in tandem (illocutionary pairs with lar-ger durational differences also showed larger differences in mean f0; voice quality, in turn, seemed to be an addi-tional cue). We suggest three possible explanations (assertive force, focus, speaker attitude) that unite the present findings on RQs in Standard Chinese with the findings on RQs in other, non-tonal languages.CO 2022 The Authors.

J	Glewwe, E				Glewwe, Eleanor			The phonological determinants of tone in English loanwords in Mandarin	PHONOLOGY				Article								This paper presents the results of a corpus study and an online loanword adaptation experiment examining the tonal adaptation of English loanwords in Mandarin. Using maximum entropy models, I control for the substantial influences of lexical tone distributions and standardisation, and uncover phonological determinants of tone beyond these lexical and conventional factors. The most important phonological determinant of tone in the corpus was English voicing, while in the experiment it was English stress-aligned pitch contours. I argue that these distinct tonal adaptation patterns constitute two different perceptual mappings, one from F0 perturbations to tone and the other from English intonation to tone, both arising due to particular borrowing contexts. I suggest that increasingly close contact between English and Mandarin may lead to more intonation-driven tonal adaptation in the latest wave of borrowing. The maximum entropy approach holds promise for the analysis of complex cases of tonal adaptation in other languages.												5	6											MAY	2021	38	2					203	239	PII S0952675721000154	10.1017/S0952675721000154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952675721000154												2026-01-16	WOS:000700895100004

Here, we explore perceptual and experiential factors that drive associative learning of labels that differ in pitch contour. Contrary to the salience hypothesis proposed in Experiment 1, English-learning 14-month-olds failed to map acoustically distinctive level and dipping labels to novel referents, even though they discriminated the labels when no potential referents were present. Conversely, infants readily mapped the less distinctive rising and dipping labels. In Experiment 2, we found that the degree of pitch variation in labels also does not account for learning. Instead, English-learning infants only learned if one of the labels had a rising pitch contour. We argue that experience with hearing and/or producing native language prosody may lead infants to initially over-interpret the role rising pitch plays in differentiating words. Together, our findings suggest that multiple factors contribute to whether specific acoustic forms will function as candidate object labels.												7	8											APR	2019	105						131	140		10.1016/j.jml.2018.12.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2018.12.004												2026-01-16	WOS:000459523200009

However, there is limited understanding regarding their integration of contextual cues in speech processing. This study aims to explore how Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD identify lexical tones in speech and nonspeech contexts, and to determine whether the size of context effect would be modulated by children's cognitive abilities. Twenty-five children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) children were asked to identify Mandarin lexical tones preceded by three types of contexts (speech, nonspeech, and nonspeech-flattened contexts). We also tested child participants' verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory capacity. Results revealed that the context effect was only observed in the speech contexts, where Mandarin-speaking children with ASD exhibited a reduced context effect compared to TD children. Moreover, TD children with higher verbal intelligence demonstrated a diminished context effect. However, nonverbal intelligence and working memory capacity were not significantly associated with the size of context effect in either group. These findings revealed a subtle yet important difference between ASD and TD children's utilization of speech contexts in lexical tone identification, and validated a speech-specific mechanism underpinning children's lexical tone normalization.												0	0											2025 MAR 7	2025										10.1007/s10803-025-06775-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10803-025-06775-2		MAR 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001438996300001
J	Yan, JT; Chen, F; Gao, XT; Peng, G				Yan, Jinting; Chen, Fei; Gao, Xiaotian; Peng, Gang			Auditory-Motor Mapping Training Facilitates Speech and Word Learning in Tone Language-Speaking Children With Autism: An Early Efficacy Study	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: It has been reported that tone language-speaking children with autism demonstrate speech-specific lexical tone processing difficulty, although they have intact or even better-than-normal processing of nonspeech/melodic pitch analogues. In this early efficacy study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) in facilitating speech and word output for Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism, in comparison with a matched non-AMMT-based control treatment. Method: Fifteen Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism spectrum disorder participated and completed all the AMMT-based treatment sessions by intoning (singing) and tapping the target words delivered via an app, whereas another 15 participants received control treatment. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to evaluate speech production accuracy and word production intelligibility across different groups and conditions. Results: Results showed that the AMMT-based treatment provided a more effective training approach in accelerating the rate of speech (especially lexical tone) and word learning in the trained items. More importantly, the enhanced training efficacy on lexical tone acquisition remained at 2 weeks after therapy and generalized to untrained tones that were not practiced. Furthermore, the low-verbal participants showed higher improvement compared to the nonverbal participants. Conclusions: These data provide the first empirical evidence for adopting the AMMT-based training to facilitate speech and word learning in Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism. This early efficacy study holds promise for improving lexical tone production in Mandarin-speaking children with autism but should be further replicated in larger scale randomized studies.

J	Sevilla, RM				Sevilla, Robert Marcelo			ACOUSTIC PATTERNS IN HONG KONG CANTONESE HESITATION MARKERS: VOWEL QUALITY AND OMNISYLLABIC TONE	JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS				Article								Hesitation markers (HMs) lie somewhere on the dividing line between linguistic and sub-linguistic, evincing at the same time crosslinguistic commonalities as well as language-specific features (Candeaet al.2005; Dingemanse andWoensdregt2020). This study seeks to expand on understanding of these lexically peripheral items by analyzing their acoustic properties in Hong Kong Cantonese (HKCT), including vowel quality and F0. Recent work by Dingemanse and Woensdregt (2020) discusses phoneticsimilarities in HMs across languages, which are constrained by adherence to the phonologies of their respective languages. However, it is unclear how HMs are incorporated into HKCT tonal phonology, which can be characterized as 'omnisyllabic' (Matisoff 1995), every syllable being associated with a lexical tone.The present study gathers acoustic data (F0, F1-F2, duration) from the PolyU Corpus of Spoken Chinese (http://wongtaksum.no-ip.info:81/corpus.htm)across 10 speakers and 196 HMs, comparing them against 525 lexical items. Results for F1-F2 clusteredaround mid-front /epsilon/, which is in line both with around the lower end of the pitch range, approaching Tones 3 and 6, which is expected given effort minimization trends. However, establishing a connection with a particular lexical tone was complicated by the similarity of Tones 3 and 6, which could not be statistically distinguished. Cross-speaker analysis showed considerable variation in F0, indicating that context, intonation, or idiolectal variation may play a substantial role. This has implications for our understanding of how peripheral items likehesitation markers are treated in omnisyllabic tone languages like Cantonese.												0	0											SEP	2024	52	3																					2026-01-16	WOS:001339028600002

Objectives: To assess perceptual accuracy of normal hearing (NH) children and pediatric CI users on speech intonation (prosody), melodic contour, and pitch ranking, and to determine potential predictors of outcomes. Hypothesis: Does perceptual accuracy for speech intonation or melodic contour differ as a function of auditory status (NH, CI), perceptual category (falling versus rising intonation/contour), pitch perception, or individual differences (e. g., age, hearing history)? Method: NH and CI groups were tested on recognition of falling intonation/contour versus rising intonation/contour presented in both spoken and melodic (sung) conditions. Pitch ranking was also tested. Outcomes were correlated with variables of age, hearing history, HINT, and CNC scores. Results: The CI group was significantly less accurate than the NH group in spoken (CI, M = 63.1%; NH, M = 82.1%) and melodic (CI, M = 61.6%; NH, M = 84.2%) conditions. The CI group was more accurate in recognizing rising contour in the melodic condition compared with rising intonation in the spoken condition. Pitch ranking was a significant predictor of outcome for both groups in falling intonation and rising melodic contour; age at testing and hearing history variables were not predictive of outcomes. Conclusion: Children with CIs were less accurate than NH children in perception of speech intonation, melodic contour, and pitch ranking. However, the larger pitch excursions of the melodic condition may assist in recognition of the rising inflection associated with the interrogative form.												28	38											APR	2013	34	3					490	498		10.1097/MAO.0b013e318287c985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0b013e318287c985												2026-01-16	WOS:000316452300025
J	Hualde, JI; Schwegler, A				Hualde, Jose Ignacio; Schwegler, Armin			Intonation in Palenquero	JOURNAL OF PIDGIN AND CREOLE LANGUAGES				Article								The least understood aspect of Palenquero phonology is its intonational system. This is a serious gap, as it is precisely in the realm of prosody that the most striking phonological differences between Palenquero and (Caribbean) Spanish are apparent. Although several authors have speculated that African influence may be at the source of Palenquero's peculiar intonation, to date published research offers no detailed information about the intonation of the creole. The goal of this study is to remedy this situation. Here we identify several specific intonational features where conservative (or older-generation) Palenquero differs from (Caribbean) Spanish. One of these features is a strong tendency to use invariant word-level contours, with a H tone on the stressed syllable and L tones on unstressed syllables, in all sentential contexts, including prenuclear positions. A second feature that we have identified is the use of a sustained phrase-final high or mid level contour in declaratives accented on the final syllable, and a long fall in declaratives accented on the penult. The final section addresses the issue of the possible origin of these intonational features. We point out similarities with Equatorial Guinea Spanish and conclude that, at some point in the history of Palenquero, the Spanish prosodic system was interpreted as involving lexical tone, in conformity with claims in the literature regarding several Atlantic creoles.												33	46												2008	23	1					1	31		10.1075/jpcl.23.1.02hua	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/jpcl.23.1.02hua												2026-01-16	WOS:000257164300001

The qTA model simulates the production of tone and intonation as a process of syllable-synchronized sequential target approximation [Xu, Y. (2005). "Speech melody as articulatorily implemented communicative functions," Speech Commun. 46, 220-251]. It adopts a set of biomechanical and linguistic assumptions about the mechanisms of speech production. The communicative functions directly modeled are lexical tone in Mandarin and lexical stress in English and focus in both languages. The qTA model is evaluated by extracting function-specific model parameters from natural speech via supervised learning (automatic analysis by synthesis) and comparing the F-0 contours generated with the extracted parameters to those of natural utterances through numerical evaluation and perceptual testing. The F-0 contours generated by the qTA model with the learned parameters were very close to the natural contours in terms of root mean square error, rate of human identification of tone, and focus and judgment of naturalness by human listeners. The results demonstrate that the qTA model is both an effective tool for research on tone and intonation and a potentially effective system for automatic synthesis of tone and intonation.												123	137											JAN	2009	125	1					405	424		10.1121/1.3037222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.3037222												2026-01-16	WOS:000262672600051
J	Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY				Zou, Ting; Caspers, Johanneke; Chen, Yiya			Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.												3	3											JUN 6	2022	13								891756	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756												2026-01-16	WOS:000813299300001

Chinese tone and intonation, both signaled by variations in pitch contours, span over shorter (local) and longer (global) temporal domains, respectively. This cross-linguistic (Chinese and English) study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that pitch contours associated with tones are processed in the left hemisphere by Chinese listeners only, whereas pitch contours associated with intonation are processed predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings argue against the view that all aspects of speech prosody are lateralized to the right hemisphere, and promote the idea that varying-sized temporal integration windows reflect a neurobiological adaptation to meet the 'prosodic needs' of a particular language.

The present study examined this assumption with one production and three perception experiments. The production experiment compared duration, intensity, formants and spectral tilt of phonated and whispered Mandarin monosyllabic utterances with four lexical tones spoken as either statements or questions. For tones, no acoustic properties were found to occur only in whispered but not in phonated utterances. For intonation, some spectral tilt measurements differed between the two phonation types. The two tone perception experiments used phonated and whispered utterances as well as amplitude-modulated noise based on those utterances as stimuli. Results show that once turned into amplitude-modulated noise, phonated and whispered tones had similar identification patterns, indicating that the non-F-0 tonal cues in whispers were already in phonated speech. The intonation perception experiment used original utterances as stimuli and showed a substantial drop in overall identification rate and an overwhelming bias towards statement. Thus the spectral tilt differences found in the acoustic analysis were not helpful for intonation perception. Possible reasons for the lack of effective enhancement in whispered speech were discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hyman, LM				Hyman, Larry M.			In defense of prosodic typology: A response to Beckman & Venditti	LINGUISTIC TYPOLOGY				Article								In two recent handbook articles, Beckman & Venditti (2010, 2011) present overviews of tone and intonation which take issue with both traditional typology and recent attempts to bring clarity to the study of prosodic typology. In the course of their coverage Beckman & Venditti question the "usefulness" of distinguishing prosodic systems by "tonemic function alone" (e.g., lexical tone, stress, intonation) and raise the question "Is typology needed?" Within this context I once again argue for a "property-driven" approach to prosodic typology whose goal is not to classify languages into prosodic types, rather to accurately characterize the same vs. different ways in which prosodic properties are exploited. We thus ask (i) whether a given language has word-level contrastive pitch ("tone"), word-level metrical structure ("stress"), both, or neither; (ii) if yes, what does the prosodic system do with the tones and/or stress, both at the word level and postlexically? Given the level-ordered nature of phonological systems, only after the first two questions are dealt with can we move on to the the question with which Beckman & Venditti are most concerned: (iii) how are the surface or output word-prosodic properties integrated with phrase-and utterance-level intonation? While Beckman & Venditti question the usefulness of "broad-stroke typologies" which have traditionally distinguished tone, stress, and intonation, their disposition to minimize systemic differences in favor of surface comparisons of phonetic realizations raises important questions concerning levels of representation and the nature of phonological typology itself.												10	14											AUG	2012	16	3					341	385		10.1515/lingty-2012-0014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/lingty-2012-0014												2026-01-16	WOS:000209107800002

This study investigated whether adult Chinese-speaking listeners with amusia were still able to learn Thai lexical tones based on stimulus frequency of statistical distribution via distributional learning, despite their degraded lexical tone perception. Method: Following a pretest-training-posttest design, 21 amusics and 23 typical, musically intact listeners were assigned into bimodal and unimodal distribution conditions. Listeners were asked to discriminate minimal pairs of Thai midlevel tone and falling tone superimposed on variable base syllables and uttered by different speakers. The perceptual accuracy for each test session and improvement from pretest to posttest were collected and analyzed between the two groups using generalized mixed-effects models. Results: When discriminating Thai lexical tones, amusics were less accurate than typical listeners. Nonetheless, similarly to control listeners, perceptual gains from pretest to posttest were observed in bimodally rather than unimodally trained amusics, as evidenced by both trained and nontrained test words. Conclusions: Amusics are able to learn lexical tones in a second or foreign context of speech. This extends previous research by showing that amusics' distributional learning of linguistic pitch remains largely preserved despite their degraded pitch processing. It is thus likely that manifestations of amusia in speech could not result from their abnormal statistical learning mechanism. This study meanwhile provides a heuristic approach for future studies to apply this paradigm into amusics' treatment to mitigate their pitch-processing disorder.												5	6											JUL	2023	66	7					2461	2477		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00572												2026-01-16	WOS:001041295400018
J	Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Huang, XN				Zhang, Caicai; Shao, Jing; Huang, Xunan			Deficits of congenital amusia beyond pitch: Evidence from impaired categorical perception of vowels in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics	PLOS ONE				Article								Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder of fine-grained pitch processing in music and speech. However, it remains unclear whether amusia is a pitch-specific deficit, or whether it affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly, such as the perception of formant frequency in vowels, apart from pitch. In this study, in order to illuminate the scope of the deficits, we compared the performance of 15 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 15 matched controls on the categorical perception of sound continua in four stimulus contexts: lexical tone, pure tone, vowel, and voice onset time (VOT). Whereas lexical tone, pure tone and vowel continua rely on frequency/spectral processing, the VOT continuum depends on duration/temporal processing. We found that the amusic participants performed similarly to controls in all stimulus contexts in the identification, in terms of the across-category boundary location and boundary width. However, the amusic participants performed systematically worse than controls in discriminating stimuli in those three contexts that depended on frequency/spectral processing (lexical tone, pure tone and vowel), whereas they performed normally when discriminating duration differences (VOT). These findings suggest that the deficit of amusia is probably not pitch specific, but affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly. Furthermore, there appeared to be differences in the impairment of frequency/spectral discrimination in speech and nonspeech contexts. The amusic participants exhibited less benefit in between-category discriminations than controls in speech contexts (lexical tone and vowel), suggesting reduced categorical perception; on the other hand, they performed inferiorly compared to controls across the board regardless of between-and within-category discriminations in nonspeech contexts (pure tone), suggesting impaired general auditory processing. These differences imply that the frequency/spectral-processing deficit might be manifested differentially in speech and nonspeech contexts in amusics D it is manifested as a deficit of higher-level phonological processing in speech sounds, and as a deficit of lower-level auditory processing in nonspeech sounds.												36	36											AUG 22	2017	12	8							e0183151	10.1371/journal.pone.0183151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183151												2026-01-16	WOS:000408085100029
J	Karlin, R				Karlin, Robin			Expanding the gestural model of lexical tone: Evidence from two dialects of Serbian	LABORATORY PHONOLOGY				Article								There is mounting evidence suggesting that temporal information is necessary in representations of lexical tone. Gestural models of tone provide a natural entry point to linking abstract association with physical realization, but remain underdeveloped. We present the results of two acoustic production studies on two dialects of Serbian, a lexical pitch accent language. In the Belgrade dialect, pitch accents are aligned relatively late in the tone-bearing unit, while in the Valjevo dialect, pitch accents are phonetically retracted, sometimes into the preceding syllable. We varied the phonetic duration of syllable onsets of candidate tone-bearing units in falling (experiment 1) and rising (experiment 2) pitch accents, and measured the effects on the timing of FO excursions. Consistent interactions between FO excursions and the segmental content indicate that the phonological system of abstract tone association is the same in both dialects, despite differences in temporal alignment. We argue that this apparent mismatch between association and alignment can be expressed straightforwardly in the Articulatory Phonology framework by allowing tone gestures to coordinate with other gestures in all the ways that segmental gestures can, rather than restricting tone to c-center coordination.												4	4											MAR 4	2022	13	1					1	43	3	10.16995/labphon.6443	http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/labphon.6443												2026-01-16	WOS:000765887000001
J	Kochanski, G; Shih, C; Jing, HY				Kochanski, G; Shih, C; Jing, HY			Quantitative measurement of prosodic strength in Mandarin	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								We describe models of Mandarin prosody that allow us to make quantitative measurements of prosodic strengths. These models use Stem-ML, which is a phenomenological model of the muscle dynamics and planning process that controls the tension of the vocal folds, and therefore the pitch of speech. Because Stem-ML describes the interactions between nearby tones, we were able to capture surface tonal variations using a highly constrained model with only one template for each lexical tone category, and a single prosodic strength per word. The model accurately reproduces the intonation of the speaker, capturing 87% of the variance of f(0) with these strength parameters. The result reveals alternating metrical patterns in words, and shows that the speaker marks a hierarchy of boundaries by controlling the prosodic strength of words. The strengths we obtain are also correlated with syllable duration, mutual information and part-of-speech. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	DiCanio, C; Benn, J; García, RC				DiCanio, Christian; Benn, Joshua; Castillo Garcia, Rey			The phonetics of information structure in Yoloxochitl Mixtec	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Research on speech prosody has shown that higher-level phonological constituents can be examined directly via their influence on low level phonetic processes (Beckman & Edwards, 1990; Fougeron & Keating, 1997). Despite the strong tradition of research in this area, the existing work has focused mainly on languages which lack lexical tone. This contributes to the view that prosodic structures show little influence on tone, i.e. a language may either have lexical tone or lexical/phrasal stress, the latter of which fits into the prosodic hierarchy. The current paper examines prosodic focus in Yoloxochitl Mixtec, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in Mexico. Using experimental data from ten speakers in the field, we investigated how sentence position, stress, and focus type influenced the realization of F-o and duration in different tonal melodies. The findings show that the tonal F-o space was expanded and raised on words produced with contrastive focus, less on words produced with narrow focus, and least on words produced under broad, sentential focus. Focus-related lengthening asymmetrically affected stressed syllables in the language more than unstressed syllables. In stressed syllables, this resulted in an increase in tonal hyperarticulation.

J	Peters, J				Peters, Joerg			Tone and intonation in the dialect of Hasselt	LINGUISTICS				Article								The West-Limburgian dialect of Hasselt has a word accent distinction comparable to the distinction between accent 1 and accent 2 in Swedish and Norwegian. To understand how, Hasselt speakers interpret the accentual contrast, a reading task was carried out in which words differing by accent class only were embedded in different prosodic contexts. The results suggest that Hasselt speakers, like speakers of the more eastern dialects of Venlo, Roermond, and Cologne, mark accent 2 by lexical tone, while accent 1 remains lexically toneless. Hasselt speakers differ, however, both in the realization and the distribution of the accentual contrast. These differences are attributed to variation in tonal association. While the eastern speakers associate tones to sonorant moras, Hasselt speakers associate tones to syllables.												9	9												2008	46	5					983	1018		10.1515/LING.2008.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/LING.2008.032												2026-01-16	WOS:000261006400005

Native Mandarin (tone language) and Malay (non-tone language) listeners completed an AX language discrimination task with four levels of signal degradation and two speech styles. Listeners in both groups showed more benefit from pitch information in read than in spontaneous speech. Mandarin listeners showed a greater benefit than Malay listeners from the inclusion of f0 information in a segmentally degraded signal, suggesting that experience with lexical tone may extend to increased attention and/or sensitivity to phrase-level pitch contours.

J	Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Chen, S				Zhang, Caicai; Shao, Jing; Chen, Si			Impaired perceptual normalization of lexical tones in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Human listeners perceive speech sounds relative to acoustic cues in context. In this study the authors examined how congenital amusia, a pitch-processing disorder, affects perceptual normalization of lexical tones according to the distribution of F0 cues in context. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 16 controls were tested on the effects of shifting F0 level in four types of contexts on tone perception: nonspeech, reversed speech, semantically anomalous speech, and meaningful speech contexts. Performance of controls replicated previous studies, showing contrastive changes of tone perception according to the shifted F0 level of anomalous and meaningful contexts, which were native speech contexts with phonological cues to estimate a talker's tone space. Effects of nonspeech and reversed contexts were small and inconsistent, and tone perception performance varied depending on the typicality of a talker's F0 range. In contrast to controls, amusics showed reduced context effects in anomalous and meaningful contexts, but largely comparable context effects in nonspeech and reversed contexts, indicating a deficit of amusics in tone normalization through phonological cues in native speech contexts. These findings suggest that the ability to perceive speech sounds relative to acoustic cues in context is not a universal endowment, and that this ability is impaired substantially in amusics.

Previous studies have mostly focused on pitch height/direction contrasts; however, languages use a variety of pitch features to signal meaning, including differences in pitch timing. In this study, we investigate infants' perception of the prosodic contrast that cues the difference between all-new information (broad focus) and the highlighting of a particular word (narrow/contrastive focus) in European Portuguese (EP), and which has been described as having pitch timing as its key feature. Using a modified version of the visual habituation paradigm, EP learning infants discriminated this contrast at 12 months but not at 7 months, deviating from previous findings of a precocious ability to perceive pitch distinctions. These results suggest different developmental trajectories of the perception of different prosodic contrasts, underlining the importance of the nature of the cues signalling a given contrast in a given language.												8	8												2016	12	1					1	13		10.1080/15475441.2015.1020376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2015.1020376												2026-01-16	WOS:000379498300001
J	Sundara, M; Frota, S				Sundara, Megha; Frota, Sonia			English-Learning Infants' Developing Sensitivity to Intonation Contours	LANGUAGES				Article								In four experiments, we investigated when and how English-learning infants perceive intonation contours that signal prosodic units. Using visual habituation, we probed infants' ability to discriminate disyllabic sequences with a fall versus a rise in pitch on the final syllable, a salient cue used to distinguish statements from questions. First, we showed that at 8 months, English-learning infants can distinguish statement falls from question rises, as has been reported previously for their European Portuguese-learning peers who have extensive experience with minimal pairs that differ just in pitch rises and falls. Next, we conducted three experiments involving 4-month-olds to determine the developmental roots of how English-learning infants begin to tune into these intonation contours. In Experiment 2, we showed that unlike 8-month-olds, monolingual English-learning 4-month-olds are unable to distinguish statement and question intonation when they are presented with segmentally varied disyllabic sequences. Monolingual English-learning 4-month-olds only partially succeeded even when tested without segmental variability and a sensitive testing procedure (Experiment 3). When tested with stimuli that had been resynthesized to remove correlated duration cues as well, 4-month-olds demonstrated only partial success (Experiment 4). We discuss our results in the context of extant developmental research on how infants tune into linguistically relevant pitch cues in their first year of life.												1	1											JUN 20	2025	10	7							148	10.3390/languages10070148	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/languages10070148												2026-01-16	WOS:001535808600001

Cantonese Tone Perception for Children Who Use a Hearing Aid and a Cochlear Implant in Opposite Ears	EAR AND HEARING				Article								Objectives: The ability to recognize tones is vital for speech perception in tonal languages. Cantonese has six tones, which are differentiated almost exclusively by pitch cues (tones 1 to 6). The differences in pitch contours among the tones are subtle, making Cantonese a challenging language for cochlear implant users. The addition of a hearing aid has been shown to improve speech perception in nontonal languages and in Mandarin Chinese. This study (1) investigates the Cantonese tone perception ability of children who use a cochlear implant and a hearing aid in opposite ears; (2) evaluates the effect of varying pitch height and pitch contour cues on Cantonese tone perception for these children; and (3) compares the Cantonese tone perception ability for using a hearing aid and a cochlear implant together versus an implant alone. Design: Eight native Cantonese speaking children using a cochlear implant and a hearing aid in opposite ears were assessed for tone perception and word identification. The tone perception test involved discriminating and ranking tone pairs from natural and artificially manipulated Cantonese tones with various pitch heights and/or pitch contours. The word identification test involved identifying Cantonese words in a four-alternative forced-choice task. All tests were performed in two device conditions: (1) cochlear implant and hearing aid together and (2) implant alone. Results: Seven of the 8 subjects performed significantly above chance in both tests using the cochlear implant alone. Results showed that both pitch height and/or pitch direction were important perceptual cues for implant users. Perception for some tones was improved by increasing the pitch height differences between the tones. The ability to discriminate and rank the tone 2/tone 5 contrast and the tone 4/tone 6 contrast was poor, as the tones in these contrasts are similar in pitch contours and onset frequencies. No significant improvement was observed after artificially increasing the pitch offset differences between the tones in the tone 2/tone 5 and the tone 4/tone 6 contrasts. Tone perception results were significantly better with the addition of the hearing aid in the nonimplanted ear compared with using the implant alone; however, word identification results were not significantly different between using the implant alone and using both the hearing aid and the implant together. None of the subjects performed worse in tone perception or in word identification when the hearing aid was added. Conclusions: Reduced ability to perceive pitch contour cues, even when artificially exaggerated, may explain some of the difficulties in Cantonese word recognition for implant users. The addition of a contralateral hearing aid could be beneficial for Cantonese tone perception for some individuals with a unilateral implant. The results encouraged Cantonese speakers to trial a hearing aid in the nonimplanted ear when using a cochlear implant.												6	7											NOV-DEC	2017	38	6					E359	E368		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000453												2026-01-16	WOS:000423077800005

Assessing prosodic skills in five European languages: Cross-linguistic differences in typical and atypical populations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY				Article								Following demand for a prosody assessment procedure, the test Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (PEPS-C), has been translated from English into Spanish, French, Flemish and Norwegian. This provides scope to examine receptive and expressive prosodic ability in Romance (Spanish and French) as well as Germanic (English and Flemish) languages, and includes the possibility of assessing these skills with regard to lexical tone (Norwegian). Cross-linguistic similarities and differences relevant to the translation are considered. Preliminary findings concerning 8-year-old neurotypical children speaking the five languages are reported. The appropriateness of investigating contrastive stress in Romance as well as Germanic languages is considered: results are reported for assessing this skill in Spanish and English speakers and suggest that in Spanish it is acquired much later than in English. We also examine the feasibility of assessing and comparing prosodic disorder in the five languages, using assessments of prosody in Spanish and English speakers with Williams syndrome as an example. We conclude that, with caveats, the original design of the UK test may indicate comparable stages of prosodic development in neurotypical children and is appropriate for the evaluation of prosodic skills for adults and children, both neurotypical and with impairment, in all five languages.												18	21											FEB	2010	12	1			SI		1	7		10.3109/17549500903093731	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/17549500903093731												2026-01-16	WOS:000275139900001

It has been shown that native speakers of French, a language without lexical stress, have difficulties storing non-native stress contrasts. We investigated whether the ability to store lexical tone (as in Mandarin Chinese) also depends on the first language (L I) prosodic structure and, if so, how. We tested participants from a stress language (German), a language without word stress (French), a language with restricted lexical tonal contrasts (Japanese), and Mandarin Chinese controls. Furthermore, German has a rich intonational structure, while French and Japanese dispose of fewer utterance-level pitch contrasts. The participants learnt associations between disyllabic non-words (4 tonal contrasts) and objects and indicated whether picture word pairs matched with what they had learnt (complete match, segmental or tonal mismatch conditions). In the tonal mismatch condition, the Mandarin Chinese controls had the highest sensitivity, followed by the German participants. The French and Japanese participants showed no sensitivity towards these tonal contrasts. Utterance-level prosody is hence better able to predict success in second language (L2) tone learning than word prosody.												27	37											JUL	2014	30	3					323	350		10.1177/0267658313510926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0267658313510926												2026-01-16	WOS:000337654200003

This cross-linguistic study evaluated the performance of imitating Cantonese lexical tones and their non-linguistic (nonspeech) counterparts by Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD. Acoustic analyses showed that, compared with typically developing peers, children with ASD exhibited increased pitch variations when imitating lexical tones, while performed similarly when imitating the nonspeech counterparts. Furthermore, Mandarin-speaking children with ASD failed to exploit the phonological knowledge of segments to improve the imitation accuracy of non-native lexical tones. These findings help clarify the speech-specific pitch processing atypicality and phonological processing deficit in tone-language-speaking children with ASD.												17	18											MAY	2022	52	5					2325	2343		10.1007/s10803-021-05123-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05123-4		JUN 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000659415100004
J	Ip, MHK; Cutler, A				Ip, Martin Ho Kwan; Cutler, Anne			Universals of listening: Equivalent prosodic entrainment in tone and non-tone languages	COGNITION				Article								In English and Dutch, listeners entrain to prosodic contours to predict where focus will fall in an utterance. Here, we ask whether this strategy is universally available, even in languages with very different phonological systems (e.g., tone versus non-tone languages). In a phoneme detection experiment, we examined whether prosodic entrainment also occurs in Mandarin Chinese, a tone language, where the use of various suprasegmental cues to lexical identity may take precedence over their use in salience. Consistent with the results from Germanic languages, response times were facilitated when preceding intonation predicted high stress on the target-bearing word, and the lexical tone of the target word (i.e., rising versus falling) did not affect the Mandarin listeners' response. Further, the extent to which prosodic entrainment was used to detect the target phoneme was the same in both English and Mandarin listeners. Nevertheless, native Mandarin speakers did not adopt an entrainment strategy when the sentences were presented in English, consistent with the suggestion that L2 listening may be strained by additional functional load from prosodic processing. These findings have implications for how universal and language-specific mechanisms interact in the perception of focus structure in everyday discourse.												22	24											SEP	2020	202								104311	10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311												2026-01-16	WOS:000551338900012
J	Zahner-Ritter, K; Zhao, TY; Einfeldt, M; Braun, B				Zahner-Ritter, Katharina; Zhao, Tianyi; Einfeldt, Marieke; Braun, Bettina			How experience with tone in the native language affects the L2 acquisition of pitch accents	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This paper tested the ability of Mandarin learners of German, whose native language has lexical tone, to imitate pitch accent contrasts in German, an intonation language. In intonation languages, pitch accents do not convey lexical information; also, pitch accents are sparser than lexical tones as they only associate with prominent words in the utterance. We compared two kinds of German pitch-accent contrasts: (1) a "non-merger" contrast, which Mandarin listeners perceive as different and (2) a "merger" contrast, which sounds more similar to Mandarin listeners. Speakers of a tone language are generally very sensitive to pitch. Hypothesis 1 (H1) therefore stated that Mandarin learners produce the two kinds of contrasts similarly to native German speakers. However, the documented sensitivity to tonal contrasts, at the expense of processing phrase-level intonational contrasts, may generally hinder target-like production of intonational pitch accents in the L2 (Hypothesis 2, H2). Finally, cross-linguistic influence (CLI) predicts a difference in the realization of these two contrasts as well as improvement with higher proficiency (Hypothesis 3, H3). We used a delayed imitation paradigm, which is well-suited for assessing L2-phonetics and -phonology because it does not necessitate access to intonational meaning. We investigated the imitation of three kinds of accents, which were associated with the sentence-final noun in short wh-questions (e.g., Wer malt denn Mandalas, lit: "Who draws PRT mandalas?" "Who likes drawing mandalas?"). In Experiment 1, 28 native speakers of Mandarin participated (14 low- and 14 high-proficient). The learners' productions of the two kinds of contrasts were analyzed using General Additive Mixed Models to evaluate differences in pitch accent contrasts over time, in comparison to the productions of native German participants from an earlier study in our lab. Results showed a more pronounced realization of the non-merger contrast compared to German natives and a less distinct realization of the merger contrast, with beneficial effects of proficiency, lending support to H3. Experiment 2 tested low-proficient Italian learners of German (whose L1 is an intonation language) to contextualize the Mandarin data and further investigate CLI. Italian learners realized the non-merger contrast more target-like than Mandarin learners, lending additional support to CLI (H3).												5	6											AUG 19	2022	13								903879	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879												2026-01-16	WOS:000861273800001
J	Xu, Y				Xu, Y			Effects of tone and focus on the formation and alignment of f0 contours	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								The present study examines how lexical tone and focus contribute to the formation and alignment off, contours in speech. This was done through an investigation of f(0) contour formation in short Mandarin sentences. These sentences all consisted of five syllables with varying tones on the middle three syllables. The sentences were produced by eight Mandarin speakers with four different focus patterns: focus on the first, second, or last word, or with no narrow focus. The f(0) patterns of these sentences were examined through point-by-point f(0) tracing, graphical comparison of averaged f(0) contours, f(0)-contour-syllable alignment analysis, and analysis of maximum, minimum f(0), and slope of f(0) contours. The results indicate that (a) while the lexical tone of a syllable is the most important determining factor for the local f(0) contour of the syllable, focus extensively modulates the global shape of the f(0) curve, which in turn affects the height and even the shape of local contours; (b) the tones of adjacent syllables also extensively influence both the shape and height of the f(0) contour of a syllable, with the preceding tone exerting more influence than the following tone; (c) despite extensive variations in shape and height, the f(0) contour of a tone remains closely aligned with the associated syllable; and (d) both focus and tonal interaction may generate substantial f(0) decline over the course of an utterance. These findings seem to be able to reduce the unpredictability in the formation and alignment of f(0) contours in speech.

J	Liu, LQ; Kager, R				Liu, Liquan; Kager, Rene			Perception of tones by bilingual infants learning non-tone languages	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION				Article								This paper examines the ability of bilingual infants who were learning Dutch and another non-tone language to discriminate tonal contrasts. All infants from 5 to 18 months of age succeeded in discriminating a tonal contrast of Mandarin Chinese (Tone 1 versus Tone 4) and showed a U-shaped pattern when facing a less acoustically salient manipulated version (contracted) of the aforementioned contrast. Specifically, infants showed initial sensitivity to the contracted contrast during their early months, followed by a loss of sensitivity at the stage where tonal perceptual reorganization typically occurs, and a sensitivity rebound by the end of the first year after birth. Compared to a previous studying of ours testing monolingual Dutch infants (Liu & Kager, 2014), the discrimination patterns of bilingual infants revealed both similarities and differences. On one hand, as with monolinguals, non-tone-learning bilingual infants' tonal perception presented plasticity influenced by contrast acoustic salience along the trajectory of perceptual reorganization; as well as a general U-shaped perceptual pattern when discriminating non-native tones. On the other hand, bilingual infants appeared to regain sensitivity to the contracted tonal contrast at an earlier age (11-12 months) in comparison with monolinguals infants (17-18 months). We provide several explanations, stemming from the simultaneous exposure to two languages, to account for the 6-month bilingual perceptual plasticity from linguistic and cognitive perspectives. The overall outcomes of the study offer insights into the infant perceptual reorganization and language development trajectory, expand on the differences between monolingual and bilingual language development, and broaden our understanding of the influence of bilingual exposure to the perception of non-native contrasts in infancy from linguistic and cognitive perspectives.												40	41											MAY	2017	20	3					561	575		10.1017/S1366728916000183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728916000183												2026-01-16	WOS:000399401100008

Yet, dynamically changing pitch has considerable ecological relevance in terms of natural speech, particularly aspects such as intonation, emotion, or lexical tone information. Twenty one children with NH and 23 children wearing a CI participated in this study, along with 18 NH adults and 6 CI adults for comparison. Listeners with Cls used their clinically assigned settings with envelope-based coding strategies. Percent correct was measured in one- or three-interval two-alternative forced choice tasks, for the direction or discrimination of harmonic complexes based on a linearly rising or falling fundamental frequency. Sweep rates were adjusted per subject, in a logarithmic scale, so as to cover the full extent of the psychometric function. Data for up- and down-sweeps were fitted separately, using a maximum-likelihood technique. Fits were similar for up- and down-sweeps in the discrimination task, but diverged in the direction task because psychometric functions for down-sweeps were very shallow. Hits and false alarms were then converted into d' and beta values, from which a threshold was extracted at a d' of 0.77. Thresholds were very consistent between the two tasks and considerably higher (worse) for CI listeners than for their NH peers. Thresholds were also higher for children than adults. Factors such as age at implantation, age at profound hearing loss, and duration of CI experience did not play any major role in this sensitivity. Thresholds of dynamic pitch sensitivity (in either task) also correlated with thresholds for static pitch sensitivity and with performance in tasks related to speech prosody.												26	27											MAR 3	2016	10								73	10.3389/fnins.2016.00073	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00073												2026-01-16	WOS:000371565200001

We investigated whether this deficit extended to pitch processing in speech, notably the pitch changes used to contrast lexical tones in tonal languages. Congenital amusics and matched controls, all non-tonal language speakers, were tested for lexical tone discrimination in Mandarin Chinese (Experiment 1) and in Thai (Experiment 2). Tones were presented in pairs and participants were required to make same/different judgments. Experiment 2 additionally included musical analogs of Thai tones for comparison. Performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls for all materials, suggesting a domain-general pitch-processing deficit. The pitch deficit of amusia is thus not limited to music, but may compromise the ability to process and learn tonal languages. Combined with acoustic analyses of the tone material, the present findings provide new insights into the nature of the pitch-processing deficit exhibited by amusics.												57	58												2011	2								120	10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00120	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00120												2026-01-16	WOS:000208863700131

Lexical and Prosodic Pitch Modifications in Cantonese Infant-directed Speech	JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE				Article								The functions of acoustic-phonetic modifications in infant-directed speech (IDS) remain a question: do they specifically serve to facilitate language learning via enhanced phonemic contrasts (the hyperarticulation hypothesis) or primarily to improve communication via prosodic exaggeration (the prosodic hypothesis)? The study of lexical tones provides a unique opportunity to shed light on this, as lexical tones are phonemically contrastive, yet their primary cue, pitch, is also a prosodic cue. This study investigated Cantonese IDS and found increased intra-talker variation of lexical tones, which more likely posed a challenge to rather than facilitated phonetic learning. Although tonal space was expanded which could facilitate phonetic learning, its expansion was a function of overall intonational modifications. Similar findings were observed in speech to pets who should not benefit from larger phonemic distinction. We conclude that lexical-tone adjustments in IDS mainly serve to broadly enhance communication rather than specifically increase phonemic contrast for learners.												16	17											NOV	2021	48	6					1235	1261	PII S0305000920000707	10.1017/S0305000920000707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305000920000707												2026-01-16	WOS:000721289100009

Brainstem encoding of speech and musical stimuli in congenital amusia: evidence from Cantonese speakers	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical processing that also impacts subtle aspects of speech processing. It remains debated at what stage(s) of auditory processing deficits in amusia arise. In this study, we investigated whether amusia originates from impaired subcortical encoding of speech On quiet and noise) and musical sounds in the brainstem. Fourteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 14 matched controls passively listened to six Cantonese lexical tones in quiet, two Cantonese tones in noise (signal-to-noise ratios at 0 and 20 dB), and two cello tones in quiet while their frequency-following responses (FFRs) to these tones were recorded. All participants also completed a behavioral lexical tone identification task. The results indicated normal brainstem encoding of pitch in speech On quiet and noise) and musical stimuli in amusics relative to controls, as measured by FFR pitch strength, pitch error, and stimulus-to-response correlation. There was also no group difference in neural conduction time or FFR amplitudes. Both groups demonstrated better FFRs to speech On quiet and noise) than to musical stimuli. However, a significant group difference was observed for tone identification, with amusics showing significantly lower accuracy than controls. Analysis of the tone confusion matrices suggested that amusics were more likely than controls to confuse between tones that shared similar acoustic features. Interestingly, this deficit in lexical tone identification was not coupled with brainstem abnormality for either speech or musical stimuli. Together, our results suggest that the amusic brainstem is not functioning abnormally, although higher-order linguistic pitch processing is impaired in amusia. This finding has significant implications for theories of central auditory processing, requiring further investigations into how different stages of auditory processing interact in the human brain.												50	50											JAN 6	2015	8								1029	10.3389/fnhum.2014.01029	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2014.01029												2026-01-16	WOS:000347516500002

Perceptual assimilation of lexical tone: The roles of language experience and visual information	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								Using Best's (1995) perceptual assimilation model (PAM), we investigated auditory-visual (AV), auditory-only (AO), and visual-only (VO) perception of Thai tones. Mandarin and Cantonese (tone-language) speakers were asked to categorize Thai tones according to their own native tone categories, and Australian English (non-tone-language) speakers to categorize Thai tones into their native intonation categories-for instance, question or statement. As comparisons, Thai participants completed a straightforward identification task, and another Australian English group identified the Thai tones using simple symbols. All of the groups also completed an AX discrimination task. Both the Mandarin and Cantonese groups categorized AO and AV Thai falling tones as their native level tones, and Thai rising tones as their native rising tones, although the Mandarin participants found it easier to categorize Thai level tones than did the Cantonese participants. VO information led to very poor categorization for all groups, and AO and AV information also led to very poor categorizations for the English intonation categorization group. PAM's predictions regarding tone discriminability based on these category assimilation patterns were borne out for the Mandarin group's AO and AV discriminations, providing support for the applicability of the PAM to lexical tones. For the Cantonese group, however, PAM was unable to account for one specific discrimination pattern-namely, their relatively good performance on the Thai high-rising contrast in the auditory conditions-and no predictions could be derived for the English groups. A full account of tone assimilation will likely need to incorporate considerations of phonetic, and even acoustic, similarity and overlap between nonnative and native tone categories.												47	52											FEB	2015	77	2					571	591		10.3758/s13414-014-0791-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-014-0791-3												2026-01-16	WOS:000350102800016

In standard processing, 400 Hz low-pass envelopes modulated either pulse trains (implant users) or noise carriers (simulations). In the modified strategy, slow-rate envelope modulations, which convey dynamic spectral variation crucial for speech understanding, were extracted by low-pass filtering (32 Hz). In addition, during voiced speech, higher-rate temporal modulation in each channel was provided by 100% amplitude-modulation by a sawtooth-like wave form whose periodicity followed the fundamental frequency (FO) of the input. Channel levels were determined by the product of the lower- and higher-rate modulation components. Both in acoustic simulations and in implant users, the ability to use intonation information to identify sentences as question or statement was significantly better with modified processing. However, while there was no difference in vowel recognition in the acoustic simulation, implant users performed worse with modified processing both in vowel recognition and in formant frequency discrimination. It appears that, while enhancing pitch perception, modified processing harmed the transmission of spectral information.

J	Hsieh, IH; Guo, YJ				Hsieh, I-Hui; Guo, Yu-Jyun			No Musician Advantage in the Perception of Degraded-Fundamental Frequency Speech in Noisy Environments	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Pitch variations of the fundamental frequency (fo) contour contribute to speech perception in noisy environments, but whether musicians confer an advantage in speech in noise (SIN) with altered fo information remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different levels of degraded fo contour (i.e., conveying lexical tone or intonation information) on musician advantage in speech-in-noise perception.Method: A cohort of native Mandarin Chinese speakers, comprising 30 trained musicians and 30 nonmusicians, were tested on the intelligibility of Mandarin Chinese sentences with natural, flattened-tone, flattened-intonation, and flattened-all fo contours embedded in background noise masked under three signal-to-noise ratios (0, -5, and -9 dB). Pitch difference thresholds and innate musical skills associated with speech-in-noise benefits were also assessed.Results: Speech intelligibility score improved with increasing signal-to-noise level for both musicians and nonmusicians. However, no musician advantage was observed for identifying any type of flattened-fo contour SIN. Musicians exhibited smaller fo pitch discrimination limens than nonmusicians, which correlated with benefits for perceiving speech with intact tone-level fo information. Regardless of musician status, performance on the pitch and accent musical skill subtests correlated with speech intelligibility score. Conclusions: Collectively, these results provide no evidence for a musician advantage for perceiving speech with distorted fo information in noisy environments. Results further show that perceptual musical skills on pitch and accent processing may benefit the perception of SIN, independent of formal musical training. Our findings suggest that the potential application of music training in speech perception in noisy backgrounds is not contingent on the ability to process fo pitch contours, at least for Mandarin Chinese speakers.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23706354												1	1											AUG	2023	66	8					2643	2655		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00662												2026-01-16	WOS:001056733600006

Development of tonal discrimination in young heritage speakers of Cantonese	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study uses the Perceptual Assimilation Model for Suprasegmentals (PAM-S) (So & Best, 2008, 2010), supported by the assumptions of the L2 Intonation Learning theory (LILt, Mennen, 2015), to investigate how young heritage speakers of Cantonese living in the United States acquired Cantonese tones. Sixty-seven heritage speakers, aged 5-11, were tested on their perception of Cantonese tonal contrasts using an ABX discrimination task. They were compared to 64 peers aged 5-12 in Hong Kong, where Cantonese is spoken as the majority language but English is also acquired from a young age. Two pairs of tones were tested: Tones 2 (mid rising) and 5 (low rising), which have similar pitch heights and contours, and Tones 1 (high level) and 4 (low falling), which have a larger phonetic contrast. As predicted, the heritage speakers were more accurate in discriminating between the more distinct pair of tones than between the more similar pair. They also scored lower than their peers from Hong Kong in both contrast conditions. Age of testing predicted accuracy for both groups, and Chinese literacy also had a significant effect for the heritage speakers. The potential lack of the Tone 2-5 contrast in the heritage speakers' input is discussed as an explanation for these findings. This study illustrates the divergence in heritage speakers' phonological development compared to majority language speakers, and shows the relevance of the PAM-S and LILt to the heritage language context.

This study investigated a modification of CIS in which one channel was dedicated to the transmission of a temporal encoding of fundamental frequency (F0). Normal hearing subjects listening to noise-excited vocoders, and implantees were tested on labelling the pitch movement of diphthongal glides, on using intonation information to identify sentences as question or statement, and on vowel recognition. There were no significant differences between modified processing and CIS in vowel recognition. However, while there was limited evidence of improved pitch perception relative to CIS with simplified F0 modulation applied to the most basal channel, in general it appears that for most implant users, restricting F0-related modulation to one channel does not provide significantly enhanced pitch information.												8	10											MAY	2007	46	5					244	253		10.1080/14992020601053340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992020601053340												2026-01-16	WOS:000247255300006
J	Braun, B; Johnson, EK				Braun, Bettina; Johnson, Elizabeth K.			Question or tone 2? How language experience and linguistic function guide pitch processing	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								How does language experience shape pitch processing? Do speakers of tone languages, which use pitch to signal lexical contrasts (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) attend to pitch movements more closely than speakers of intonation languages (e.g., Dutch)? Contradictory findings have been reported in the literature. In the current study, we hypothesize that listeners should be particularly attentive to any pitch information that signals meaningful information in the native language. This includes pitch movements signaling lexical contrasts (present in tone languages only) as well as postlexical contrasts (present in all languages). Both Mandarin and Dutch listeners performed speeded ABX match to sample tasks on the same sets of nonsense words. As predicted, the same pitch movements were attended to differentially by the two language populations depending on the role that information played in the native language. Mandarin listeners were more attentive than Dutch listeners to pitch movements as these signaled potential lexical contrasts in Mandarin (but not Dutch). Importantly, Dutch listeners were more attentive to pitch movements signaling postlexical information than to pitch movements signaling no meaningful linguistic information. These findings underscore the importance of postlexical information in online speech processing and explain apparent contradictions in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, Y; Xu, Y				Chen, Yue; Xu, Yi			Sequential perception of tone and focus in parallel-A computational simulation	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								Speech is produced continuously over time. So, the information it conveys, including intonational functions, also unfolds over time. But many intonational functions are encoded across whole utterances rather than only within certain words. How can perception process speech signals continuously over time, even for communicative functions that are globally encoded? In this study we used computational simulation to test the idea that even for intonational functions with large temporal scopes, it is possible to process f0 contours syllable-by-syllable, and recognize the functions by continuous estimation of progressive probabilistic inference. We trained SVM and GRU models to simulate the perception of Mandarin tone and sentence focus with either syllable-sized or sentence-sized f0 contours as input. The sentence-wide f0 contours are gated at different syllable locations to test the incrementality of the recognition of tone and intonation. We also tested human listeners' perception of tone and focus with full and fragmented f0 contours from the same dataset to evaluate the validity of the simulated perception. The results showed that the simulated syllable-by-syllable processing of tone and focus generated the closest recognition patterns to human perception. The simulations also show that there is little difference whether tone and focus are recognized separately or as tone-focus combinations, which suggests that despite sharing the same acoustic dimension, the two functions are sufficiently separated from each other in their f0 coding.												0	0											MAR	2025	168								103173	10.1016/j.specom.2024.103173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2024.103173		DEC 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001413433300001

Following the work of Marslen-Wilson, Tyler, Warren, Gremer, and Lee (1992), a cross-modal lexical decision task was performed by LHD and RHD subjects, as well as by adults without brain pathology (NC). Subjects listened to sentences with attachment ambiguities with either congruent or incongruent prosody, while performing a visual lexical decision task. Results showed that each of the unilaterally damaged populations differed from each other, as well as from the NCs in terms of sensitivity regarding prosodic cues. Specifically, the RHD group was insensitive to sentence prosody as a whole. This was in contrast to the LHD patients, who responded to the prosodic manipulation, but in the unexpected direction. Results are discussed in terms of current hypotheses regarding the hemispheric lateralization of prosodic cues. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

J	Shao, J; Zhang, CC				Shao, Jing; Zhang, Caicai			Talker normalization in typical Cantonese-speaking listeners and congenital amusics: Evidence from event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL				Article								Despite the lack of invariance in the mapping between the acoustic signal and phonological representation, typical listeners are capable of using information of a talker's vocal characteristics to recognize phonemes, a process known as "talker normalization". The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100-150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the "active control theory". On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual "anchoring" deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.												9	9												2019	23								101814	10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814												2026-01-16	WOS:000485804400006

Both views arise from the assumption within Autosegmental-Metrical theory that the phonological representations of intonational categories can be discerned more-or-less directly from the string of intentional-seeming changes of direction in the F0 curve, identified as production 'targets'. Two perceptual experiments reveal that, at least in American English, this view critically oversimplifies how pitch accents containing High tones are defined and distinguished: instead, both the shape of the rise and the shape of the fall are seen to contribute to the alignment of the overall bulk of the high region, defined by the rise-fall shape, with the segmental string, and thus to its categorization by listeners as an early, mid or late rise-fall (H + !H*, L + H*, or L* + H). These findings are consistent with the view that the Tonal Center of Gravity (TCoG) of the rise-fall shape as a whole, rather than an F0 turning point per se, is what speakers align with segmental content to distinguish different pitch accent categories. Questioning the primacy of the turning points as the phonetic targets for these pitch accents, in turn, seriously problematizes standard assumptions about the nature of phonological representations of intonation and their relation to the signal.

It remains to be elucidated whether hemispheric lateralization is based on higher-level prosodic representations or lower-level encoding of acoustic cues, or both. A cross-language (Chinese; English) fMRI study was conducted to examine brain activity elicited by selective attention to Chinese intonation (I) and tone (T) presented in three-syllable (I3, T3) and one-syllable (I1, T1) utterance pairs in a speeded response, discrimination paradigm. The Chinese group exhibited greater activity than the English in a left inferior parietal region across tasks (I1, I3, T1, T3). Only the Chinese group exhibited a leftward asymmetry in inferior parietal and posterior superior temporal (I1, I3, T1, T3), anterior temporal (I1, I3, T1, T3), and frontopolar (I1, I3) regions. Both language groups shared a rightward asymmetry in the mid portions of the superior temporal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus irrespective of prosodic unit or temporal interval. Hemispheric laterality effects enable us to distinguish brain activity associated with higher-order prosodic representations in the Chinese group from that associated with lower-level acoustic/auditory processes that are shared among listeners regardless of language experience. Lateralization is influenced by language experience that shapes the internal prosodic representation of an external auditory signal. We propose that speech prosody perception is mediated primarily by the RH, but is left-lateralized to task-dependent regions when language processing is required beyond the auditory analysis of the complex sound.

J	Deutsch, D; Henthorn, T				Deutsch, D; Henthorn, T			Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework	MUSIC PERCEPTION				Article								Absolute pitch is generally considered to reflect a rare musical endowment; however, its characteristics are puzzling and its genesis is unclear. We describe two experiments in which native speakers of tone languages-Mandarin and Vietnamese-were found to display a remarkably precise and stable form of absolute pitch in enunciating words. We further describe a third experiment in which speakers of English displayed less stability on an analogous task. Based on these findings, and considering the related literatures on critical periods in speech development, and the neurological underpinnings of lexical tone, we propose a framework for the genesis of absolute pitch. The framework assumes that absolute pitch originally evolved as a feature of speech, analogous to other features such as vowel quality, and that speakers of tone language naturally acquire this feature during the critical period for speech acquisition. We further propose that the acquisition of absolute pitch by rare individuals who speak an intonation language may be associated with a critical period of unusually long duration, so that it encompasses the age at which the child can take music lessons. We conclude that the potential to acquire absolute pitch is universally present at birth, and that it can be realized by enabling the infant to associate pitches with verbal labels during the critical period for speech acquisition.												115	148											SPR	2004	21	3					339	356		10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339												2026-01-16	WOS:000220273000005
J	Zhang, CC; Shao, J				Zhang, Caicai; Shao, Jing			Normal pre-attentive and impaired attentive processing of lexical tones in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				Article								The neural underpinnings of congenital amusia, an innate neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing, are not well understood. Previous studies suggest that amusia primarily impairs attentive processing (P300) of small pitch deviations in music, leaving pre-attentive pitch processing (mismatch negativity or MMN) more or less intact. However, it remains unknown whether the same neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficiency underlies pitch processing in speech, where amusics also often show impairment behaviorally. The current study examined how lexical tones are processed in pre-attentive (MMN) and attentive (P300) conditions in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 matched controls. At the pre-attentive level, Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited normal MMN responses to lexical tone changes, even for tone pairs with small pitch differences (mid level vs. low level tone; high rising vs. low rising tone). However, at the attentive level, amusics exhibited reduced P3a amplitude for all tone pairs, and further reduced P3b amplitude for tone pairs with small pitch differences. These results suggest that the amusic brain detects tone changes normally pre-attentively, but shows impairment in consciously detecting the same tone differences. Consistent with previous findings in nonspeech pitch processing, this finding provides support for a domain-general neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficient attentive pitch processing in amusia.												12	12											MAY 30	2018	8								8420	10.1038/s41598-018-26368-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26368-7												2026-01-16	WOS:000433539800018

Previous research using a prototype of the strategy demonstrated significant benefits in musical pitch and lexical tone discrimination tasks with no degradation in speech recognition when compared with the clinical Advanced Combination Encoder (ACE) strategy in a small group of subjects. Based on those studies, a modified version of the strategy was implemented in the commercial Nucleus CP900 series processor. The aims of the present study were to establish whether the CP900 OPAL implementation continued to provide improved F0 pitch perception in a speech intonation task with no degradation to speech perception in quiet and noise, when compared with the clinical ACE strategy in a larger cohort of subjects. Further aims were to evaluate fitting procedures and subject acclimatization to the strategy after take-home experience. Design: Twenty experienced adult cochlear implant recipients were enrolled in the study. Two subjects withdrew during the study leaving 18 sets of data for analysis. A repeated-measures single-subject design with take-home experience was used to test for improved speech intonation perception using OPAL compared with ACE and for comparable performance between strategies for open-set word recognition in quiet at two presentation levels, sentence recognition in adaptive 4-talker babble noise, and speech intelligibility ratings. The stimulation rate employed for OPAL was 1200 pulses per second/channel which was higher than the default clinical rate of 900 pulses per second/channel used for ACE by all subjects in the present study. Two variations of the OPAL "F0 restore gain" (the gain applied to restore the loudness of modulated channels) were investigated: "custom" measured per subject and "default" which was the average of all subject custom gains. Results: A significant group mean benefit on the intonation test of 8.5% points was shown for OPAL compared with ACE. There was a significant period of adaptation to OPAL with significantly poorer sentence in noise scores acutely and after only 2 weeks of take-home experience. After 4 weeks of take-home experience, comparable word perception in quiet and sentence perception in noise for OPAL were obtained. Furthermore, there was good subject acceptability in the field with comparable speech intelligibility ratings between strategies. Results of the fitting procedure showed that OPAL did not require any additional steps compared with fitting of ACE. A default F0 restore gain provided comparable outcomes to a custom gain setting. Conclusions: The CP900 OPAL implementation provided a significant benefit to perception of speech intonation when compared with ACE. Comparable speech perception (in quiet and noise) and subjective ratings of speech intelligibility between strategies were also achieved after a period of acclimatization. These outcomes are consistent with results of earlier studies using prototype versions of the strategy and reaffirm its potential for improvement of F0 pitch perception in speech while preserving coding of segmental speech information. Furthermore, the OPAL strategy can be programmed into subject's processors using the same fitting procedures used for ACE thereby simplifying its adoption in clinical settings.												18	18											MAY-JUN	2019	40	3					555	567		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000627												2026-01-16	WOS:000466796000011
J	Zheng, TT; Levelt, CC; Chen, YY				Zheng, Tingting; Levelt, Clara C.; Chen, Yiya			The affective iconicity of lexical tone: Evidence from standard Chinesea)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Previous studies suggested that pitch characteristics of lexical tones in Standard Chinese influence various sensory perceptions, but whether they iconically bias emotional experience remained unclear. We analyzed the arousal and valence ratings of bi-syllabic words in two corpora (Study 1) and conducted an affect rating experiment using a carefully designed corpus of bi-syllabic words (Study 2). Two-alternative forced-choice tasks further tested the robustness of lexical tones' affective iconicity in an auditory nonce word context (Study 3). Hierarchical linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and cross-validation were employed to understand the relationship between lexical tones and the emotional responses of tone-carrying words. Results consistently indicated that words with a falling-falling tonal sequence, both real and nonce words, received higher arousal ratings than those with rising-rising and rising-low tones. Only in nonce words, the high-high sequence was more likely to be associated with the low-arousal option; the falling-falling tone sequence was more often linked to negative-valence choice, while high-high and rising-rising tones with positive-valence. These findings, though subtle, suggest that the use of pitch in lexical tones influences emotional responses during the processing of tone-carrying words, pointing to an inherent iconic quality in lexical tones that may subtly shape speakers' emotional experiences.												2	2											JAN	2025	157	1					396	408		10.1121/10.0034863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0034863												2026-01-16	WOS:001405930900002

Mandarin tone recognition in English speakers with normal hearing and with cochlear implants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY				Article								Objective: Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant users have difficulty perceiving tonal changes in speech with current signal processing strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether English-speaking cochlear implant and normal hearing listeners can be trained to recognise closed-set Mandarin tones. The validity of using native-English speakers to evaluate Mandarin tone perception in cochlear implants was tested. Design: Two groups of native-English speaking participants were evaluated. All listeners were given training rounds and evaluation rounds in which their tonal identification was tested. The normal-hearing group was also tested with acoustic simulations of the traditional Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) strategy. Study sample: Ten normal-hearing English speakers and seven cochlear implant listeners participated. Results: The normal-hearing group correctly identified unprocessed tones at 87% and CIS-processed tones at 58% on average. The cochlear implant listeners achieved 56% correct identification on average. Conclusions: This level of performance for native English speaking CI users was comparable to previous studies using native Mandarin-speaking CI listeners, which showed a mean of 59% in 19 CI users.												1	2											DEC 2	2019	58	12					913	922		10.1080/14992027.2019.1632498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2019.1632498		JUN 2019										2026-01-16	WOS:000473884500001
J	Rhee, N; Chen, AJ; Kuang, JJ				Rhee, Nari; Chen, Aoju; Kuang, Jianjing			Musicality and Age Interaction in Tone Development	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Vocal pitch, which involves not only F0 but also multiple covarying acoustic cues is central to linguistic perception and production at various levels of prosodic structure. Recent studies on language development have shown that differences in learners' musicality affect the F0 cue development in perception of sentence-level intonation or in prosodic realization of focus. This study aims to contribute toward a fuller understanding of the effect of musicality on linguistic pitch development via a close investigation of the relationship between musicality, age, and lexical tone production covering both F0 and spectral cues in children. Forty-three native Mandarin-speaking children between the ages of 4 and 6 years are recruited to participate in both a semi-spontaneous tone production task and a musicality test. For each age (4, 5, and 6 years) and musicality (below or above the median score of each age group) group, the contrastivity of the four tones is evaluated by performing automatic tone classification using three sets of acoustic cues (F0, spectral cues, and both). It has been found that higher musicality is associated with higher contrastivity of the tones produced at the age of 4 and 5 years, but not at the age of 6 years. These results suggest that musicality promotes earlier development of tone production only in earlier stages of prosodic development; by the age of 6 years, the musicality advantage in tone production subsides.												4	4											FEB 21	2022	16								804042	10.3389/fnins.2022.804042	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.804042												2026-01-16	WOS:000766956500001
J	Prom-on, S; Liu, F; Xu, Y				Prom-on, Santitham; Liu, Fang; Xu, Yi			Post-low bouncing in Mandarin Chinese: Acoustic analysis and computational modeling	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Post-low bouncing is a phenomenon whereby after reaching a very low pitch in a low lexical tone, F-0 bounces up and then gradually drops back in the following syllables. This paper reports the results of an acoustic analysis of the phenomenon in two Mandarin Chinese corpora and presents a simple mechanical model that can effectively simulate this bouncing effect. The acoustic analysis shows that most of the F-0 dynamic features profiling the bouncing effect strongly correlate with the amount of F-0 lowering in the preceding low-tone syllable, and that the additional F-0 raising commences at the onset of the first post-low syllable. Using the quantitative Target Approximation model, this bouncing effect was simulated by adding an acceleration adjustment to the initial F-0 state of the first post-low syllable. A highly linear relation between F-0 lowering and estimated acceleration adjustment was found. This relation was then used to effectively simulate the bouncing effect in both the neutral tone and the full tones. The results of the analysis and simulation are consistent with the hypothesis that the bouncing effect is due to a temporary perturbation of the balance between antagonistic forces in the laryngeal control in producing a very low pitch.

J	Androsova, SV; Karavaeva, VG; Zhang, ZW				Androsova, Svetlana V.; Karavaeva, Veronika G.; Zhang, Zianwen			PITCH VARIATION FOR CHINESE SYLLABLES OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION LOAD (BASED ON COMMERCIAL AND SOCIAL RADIO ADS)	CHUZHDOEZIKOVO OBUCHENIE-FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING				Article								F0 is an important cue present in all vocalic segments, a parameter to differentiate between voiced and voiceless consonants, a relative phonological feature of syllable in tonal languages and a crucial feature of intonation. This paper aims to investigate pitch variation patterns in Mandarin Chinese depending on the syllable information load (Factor 1) in one type of discourse - advertising with the subdivision into social and commercial ads (Factor 2) considering gender differences (Factor 3). 1249 syllable tokens were selected for acoustic measurements, each syllable occurring twice - in the informative and uninformative utterance parts. The information load was determined perceptually: the syllable was considered informative when agreed by the minimum of 60% of listeners, other syllables were considered uninformative. Depending on lexical tone (T1 - T4 and T0), the measurements included average pitch values, declination/inclination starting and ending points (mean values). These parameters were used to judge about relevant pitch features - average height and declination/inclination slope. As a result, a consistent parameter increase in commercial ads vs. social ads and on informative syllables vs. uninformative ones was observed for all tones except T0 that showed the opposite trend in expressing information-based partition. Another finding was tone substitution that marked both informative and uninformative parts but was more frequent in the latter. Substitute tone frequency ranks did not depend on any of the three factors except for T0. High predictability of pitch variation patterns make them applicable in teaching Chinese as L2 in terms of speaking and listening for general and specific purposes.												0	1												2022	49	5					440	450		10.53656/for22.512pitc	http://dx.doi.org/10.53656/for22.512pitc												2026-01-16	WOS:000887241700002
J	Ma, WY; Zhou, P; Singh, L; Gao, LQ				Ma, Weiyi; Zhou, Peng; Singh, Leher; Gao, Liqun			Spoken word recognition in young tone language learners: Age-dependent effects of segmental and suprasegmental variation	COGNITION				Article								The majority of the world's languages rely on both segmental (vowels, consonants) and suprasegmental (lexical tones) information to contrast the meanings of individual words. However, research on early language development has mostly focused on the acquisition of vowel-consonant languages. Developmental research comparing sensitivity to segmental and suprasegmental features in young tone learners is extremely rare. This study examined 2- and 3-year-old monolingual tone learners' sensitivity to vowels and tones. Experiment la tested the influence of vowel and tone variation on novel word learning. Vowel and tone variation hindered word recognition efficiency in both age groups. However, tone variation hindered word recognition accuracy only in 2-year-olds, while 3-year-olds were insensitive to tone variation. Experiment 1b demonstrated that 3-year-olds could use tones to learn new words when additional support was provided, and additionally, that Tone 3 words were exceptionally difficult to learn. Experiment 2 confirmed a similar pattern of results when children were presented with familiar words. This study is the first to show that despite the importance of tones in tone languages, vowels maintain primacy over tones in young children's word recognition and that tone sensitivity in word learning and recognition changes between 2 and 3 years of age. The findings suggest that early lexical processes are more tightly constrained by variation in vowels than by tones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wong, P; Ng, KWS				Wong, Puisan; Ng, Kelly Wing Sum			Testing the Hyperarticulation and Prosodic Hypotheses of Child-Directed Speech: Insights From the Perceptual and Acoustic Characteristics of Child-Directed Cantonese Tones	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: The function of child-directed speech has been debated for decades. This study examined the perceptual and acoustic characteristics of child- and adult-directed Cantonese tones to test the hyperarticulation and prosodic hypotheses that have been proposed to account for the acoustic modifications in child-directed speech. Method: Sixty-two mother-child dyads participated in the study. The mothers verbally labeled 30 pictures in monosyllabic isolated words and in the final position of a carrier sentence to the experimenter and their 1- to 5-year-old children. The 8,634 adult-and child-directed productions were low-pass filtered to eliminate lexical information and presented to 5 judges for tone identification. Acoustic analysis was performed on the productions. Results: Acoustically, child-directed tones were produced with an elevated pitch, and the pitch level decreased as the child's age increased. Acoustic contrasts between phonetically similar and more confusing tones were not enhanced in child-directed speech, and unexpectedly, child-directed tones were identified with a lower accuracy than adult-directed tones. The perceptual errors of child-directed tones mirrored the errors found in identifying tones excised from sentence-final position, which had a pitch-lowering effect on the tones. The lower perceptual accuracy, the lack of enhanced acoustic contrasts in confusing tone pairs, and the similarities in the error patterns in identifying tones in child-directed speech and tones in utterance-final position suggest that the acoustic modifications in child-directed tones are prosodic effects serving pragmatic purposes. Conclusion: The findings reject the hyperarticulation hypothesis and support the prosodic hypothesis of child-directed speech.												8	9											AUG	2018	61	8					1907	1925		10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0375												2026-01-16	WOS:000444980200004
J	Ortega-Llebaria, M; Wu, ZH				Ortega-Llebaria, Marta; Wu, Zhaohong			Chinese-English Speakers' Perception of Pitch in Their Non-Tonal Language: Reinterpreting English as a Tonal-Like Language	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Changing the F0-contour of English words does not change their lexical meaning. However, it changes the meaning in tonal languages such as Mandarin. Given this important difference and knowing that words in the two languages of a bilingual lexicon interact, the question arises as to how Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in their bilingual lexicon. The few studies that addressed this question showed that Mandarin-English speakers did not perceive pitch in English words as native English speakers did. These studies, however, used English words as stimuli failing to examine nonwords and Mandarin words. Consequently, possible pre-lexical effects and L1 transfer were not ruled out. The present study fills this gap by examining pitch perception in Mandarin and English words and nonwords by Mandarin-English speakers and a group of native English controls. Results showed the tonal experience of Chinese-English speakers modulated their perception of pitch in their non-tonal language at both pre-lexical and lexical levels. In comparison to native English controls, tonal speakers were more sensitive to the acoustic salience of F0-contours in the pre-lexical processing due to top-down feedback. At the lexical level, Mandarin-English speakers organized words in their two languages according to similarity criteria based on both F0 and segmental information, whereas only the segmental information was relevant to the control group. These results in perception together with consistently reported production patterns in previous literature suggest that Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in English as if it was a one-tone language.												11	11											JUN	2021	64	2			SI		467	487	0023830919894606	10.1177/0023830919894606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830919894606		JAN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000507060400001
J	Biocina, Z; Varosanec-Skaric, G; Basic, I				Biocina, Zdravka; Varosanec-Skaric, Gordana; Basic, Iva			THE PROSODIC SISTEM OF PRAZNICA	FLUMINENSIA				Article								This paper examines the prosodic system of the Cakavian dialect of Praznica. Previous studies of Cakavian dialects spoken on the island of Brac have revealed the existence of a classic Cakavian three-accent system, consisting of a short-falling accent, a long-falling accent, and an acute, as well as pre-accentual length. This paper does not intend to question previous studies of the Brac local dialects, because these have been based mainly on listeners' perceptions, but it intends to demonstrate and describe the complex prosodic system of the dialect of Praznica through acoustic analysis. Furthermore, the paper aims to find out if older speakers have preserved a more archaic prosodic system in comparison with groups of younger and middle-aged speakers. For this purpose, 15 speakers were recorded and divided into groups according to age and gender. The criteria for selecting the speakers were that they had to be originally from Praznica, that they had lived there for the last 10 years, and that both of their parents were from Praznica. The material for recording consisted of an open list of topics for spontaneous spoken utterance. Words with the least influence of sentence intonation on the lexical tone were chosen for acoustic analysis in Praat. Frequency direction, frequency range, and duration as well as the tone level of the post-accented syllable were calculated and examined for vowels with different accents and phonological quantity. The results of the acoustic analysis show that the speakers from Praznica, apart from the expected three Cakavian accents and pre-accentual length, also have short-rising and long-rising accents and post-accentual length. No major differences were found in the prosodic system in terms of age or gender, except for greater tone differentiation among female speakers.												0	0												2018	30	1					103	126		10.31820/f.30.1.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.31820/f.30.1.6												2026-01-16	WOS:000433006000008
J	Han, MR; de Jong, NH; Kager, R				Han, Mengru; de Jong, Nivja H.; Kager, Rene			Lexical Tones in Mandarin Chinese Infant-Directed Speech: Age-Related Changes in the Second Year of Life	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Tonal information is essential to early word learning in tone languages. Although numerous studies have investigated the intonational and segmental properties of infant-directed speech (IDS), only a few studies have explored the properties of lexical tones in IDS. These studies mostly focused on the first year of life; thus little is known about how lexical tones in IDS change as children's vocabulary acquisition accelerates in the second year (Goldfield and Reznick, 1990; Bloom, 2001). The present study examines whether Mandarin Chinese mothers hyperarticulate lexical tones in IDS addressing 18-and 24-month-old children-at which age children are learning words at a rapid speed-vs. adult-directed speech (ADS). Thirty-nine Mandarin Chinese-speaking mothers were tested in a semi-spontaneous picture-book-reading task, in which they told the same story to their child (IDS condition) and to an adult (ADS condition). Results for the F0 measurements (minimum F0, maximum F0, and F0 range) of tone in the speech data revealed a continuum of differences among IDS addressing 18-month-olds, IDS addressing 24-month-olds, and ADS. Lexical tones in IDS addressing 18-month-old children had a higher minimum F0, higher maximum F0, and larger pitch range than lexical tones in ADS. Lexical tones in IDS addressing 24-month-old children showed more similarity to ADS tones with respect to pitch height: there were no differences in minimum F0 and maximum F0 between ADS and IDS. However, F0 range was still larger. These results suggest that lexical tones are generally hyperarticulated in Mandarin Chinese IDS addressing 18-and 24-month-old children despite the change in pitch level over time. Mandarin Chinese mothers hyperarticulate lexical tones in IDS when talking to toddlers and potentially facilitate tone acquisition and word learning.												13	14											APR 4	2018	9								434	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00434	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00434												2026-01-16	WOS:000429243200001
J	So, CK; Best, CT				So, Connie K.; Best, Catherine T.			PHONETIC INFLUENCES ON ENGLISH AND FRENCH LISTENERS' ASSIMILATION OF MANDARIN TONES TO NATIVE PROSODIC CATEGORIES	STUDIES IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION				Article								This study examined how native speakers of Australian English and French, nontone languages with different lexical stress properties, perceived Mandarin tones in a sentence environment according to their native sentence intonation categories (i-Categories) in connected speech. Results showed that both English and French speakers categorized Mandarin tones primarily on the phonetic similarities of the pitch contours between the Mandarin tones and their native i-Categories. Moreover, French but not English speakers were able to detect the fine-detailed phonetic differences between Tone 3 (T3) and Tone 4 (T4; i.e., low or low-falling tone vs. high-falling tone), which suggests that the stress differences between these languages may affect nonnative tone perception: English uses lexical stress, whereas French does not. In the discrimination task, the French listeners' performance was better than that of the English listeners. For each group, discrimination of the Tone 1 (T1)-T4 and Tone 2 (T2)-T3 pairs was consistently and significantly lower than that of the other tone pairs, and the difference between T1-T4 and T2-T3 was significant. Discrimination of the Mandarin tone pairs was not fully predicted by pairwise categorizations to native i-Categories, however. Some discrimination differences were observed among tone pairs showing the same assimilation patterns. Phonetic overlaps in native i-Category choices for the Mandarin tones, strength of categorization (So, 2012), and tonal coarticulation effects (Xu, 1994, 1997) may offer possible accounts of these discrepancies between categorization and discrimination performance. These findings support the perceptual assimilation model for suprasegmentals (So & Best, 2008, 2010a, 2010b, 2011, 2013), extended to categorization of nonnative tone words within sentence contexts to native i-Categories.												83	96											JUN	2014	36	2					195	221		10.1017/S0272263114000047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0272263114000047												2026-01-16	WOS:000336739000002

Pitch Variation in Children With Childhood Apraxia of Speech: Preliminary Findings	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY				Article								Introduction: Pitch variation, which refers to one's ability to vary fundamental frequency (F0) within or between syllables when speaking, has not been investigated in children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). However, pitch variation plays an important role in tone languages, as varying F0 patterns communicate different lexical meanings. This study investigated pitch variation abilities in individuals with CAS via the tone-sequencing tasks (TSTs), focusing on task performance and the effects of syllable structure, lexical status, and tones. Method: Three Cantonese-speaking children with CAS (aged 3;7-5;8 [years;months]) and six children without CAS participated in the study. Children without CAS were divided into two control groups, comprising those with speech and/or language impairment or typical development. TSTs consisted of 56 sets of five repetitions of stimuli. The stimuli varied in syllable structure, lexical status, and tones. Percentage of tones correct (PTC), consistency scores, F0 values, and acoustic repetition duration were measured. Results: The CAS group performed more poorly than the control groups on the TST with respect to tone accuracy, consistency, and repetition duration. No interaction effects between group and syllable structure or group and lexical status were found. No significant difference was found on F0 values across time between Tone 1 and Tone 2 syllables in the CAS group. However, interaction effects between group and time points of F0 values on Tone 2 syllables were found. Discussion: The results suggest that children with CAS have difficulty with pitch variation, which was revealed on the TST with respect to tone accuracy, consistency, and repetition duration. Moreover, children with CAS have difficulty in varying F0 values to produce high-rising tones and tend to use high-level tones to substitute. Clinically, the TST may be useful to assist in the diagnosis of CAS. Isolated vowel stimuli may be useful to test young children or children with severe impairment. Future investigations and development of a normed tool for children with CAS are suggested.												14	14											JUN	2021	30	3		S	SI		1511	1524		10.1044/2021_AJSLP-20-00150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_AJSLP-20-00150												2026-01-16	WOS:000663328000015
J	Zhu, SF; Wong, LLN; Chen, F				Zhu, Shufeng; Wong, Lena L. N.; Chen, Fei			Development and validation of a new Mandarin tone identification test	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY				Article								Objectives: The objectives of this study were to develop a new Mandarin tone identification test (MTIT) to assess the Mandarin tone identification ability of children with hearing impairment (HI) and at age around 7 years; and to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the MTIT. Methods: The word materials to be used in the MTIT were developed in Phase I. Monosyllables were chosen to represent the daily repertoire of young children and to avoid the influence of co-articulation and intonation. Each test stimulus set contained four words, with one target, one containing contrastive tone, and two unrelated distracters. All words were depicted using simple pictures, and the test targets in quiet or in noise were presented using recorded stimuli on a custom software. Phase II evaluated the reliability and sensitivity of the MTIT. Participants were 50 normal-hearing native-Mandarin speakers around 7 years of age. Results: In Phase I, the MTIT was developed as described above. The final test consists of 51 words that are within the vocabulary repertoire of children aged 7 years. In Phase II, with the Mandarin tone identification scores collected from 50 children, the repeated measure ANOVA showed a significant main effect of S/N on MTIT performance (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference in performance across the five S/N conditions (p < 0.01) when S/N varied from -30 to -10 dB. Cronbach's alpha at -15 dB S/N was 0.66, suggesting satisfactory internal consistency reliability. A paired-samples t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the test-retest scores across the five S/N conditions (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with the available Mandarin tone identification tools, MTIT systematically evaluated the tone identification performance in noisy environment for normal hearing children at age around 7 years. Results also showed satisfactory internal consistency reliability, good test-retest reliability and good sensitivity. In the near future, MTIT could be used to evaluate tone perception ability of children with hearing impairment and help to design hearing rehabilitation strategies for this population at the age critical for their language learning.

While criteria for cochlear implantation have expanded to infants as young as 6 months, little is known regarding infants' processing of suprasegmental-prosodic cues which are known to be important for the first stages of language acquisition. Lexical stress is an example of such a cue, which, in hearing infants, has been shown to assist in segmenting words from fluent speech and in distinguishing between words that differ only the stress pattern. To date, however, there are no data on the ability of infants with CIs to perceive lexical stress. Such information will provide insight to the speech characteristics that are available to these infants in their first steps of language acquisition. This is of particular interest given the known limitations that the CI device has in transmitting speech information that is mediated by changes in fundamental frequency. Design: Two groups of infants participated in this study. The first group included 20 profoundly hearing-impaired infants with CI, 12 to 33 months old, implanted under the age of 2.5 years (median age of implantation = 14.5 months), with 1 to 6 months of CI use (mean = 2.7 months) and no known additional problems. The second group of infants included 48 NH infants, 11 to 14 months old with normal development and no known risk factors for developmental delays. Infants were tested on their ability to discriminate between nonsense words that differed on their stress pattern only (/doti/ versus /doti/ and /doti/ versus /doti/) using the visual habituation procedure. The measure for discrimination was the change in looking time between the last habituation trial (e.g., /doti/) and the novel trial (e.g., /doti/). Results: (1) Infants with CI showed discrimination between lexical stress pattern with only limited auditory experience with their implant device, (2) discrimination of stress patterns in infants with CI was reduced compared with that of infants with NH, (3) both groups showed directional asymmetry in discrimination, that is, increased discrimination from the uncommon to the common stress pattern in Hebrew (/doti/ versus /doti/) compared with the reversed condition. Conclusions: The CI device transmitted sufficient acoustic information (amplitude, duration, and fundamental frequency) to allow discrimination between stress patterns in young hearing-impaired infants with CI. The present pattern of results is in support of a discrimination model in which both auditory capabilities and "top-down" interactions are involved. That is, the CI infants detected changes between stressed and unstressed syllables after which they developed a bias for the more common weak-strong stress pattern in Hebrew. The latter suggests that infants with CI were able to extract the statistical distribution of stress patterns by listening to the ambient language even after limited auditory experience with the CI device. To conclude, in relation to processing of lexical stress patterns, infants with CI followed similar developmental milestones as hearing infants thus establishing important prerequisites for early language acquisition.												18	20											MAR-APR	2016	37	2					225	234		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000243												2026-01-16	WOS:000371748300011
