J	Lindfield, KC; Wingfield, A; Goodglass, H				Lindfield, KC; Wingfield, A; Goodglass, H			The role of prosody in the mental lexicon	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on the Mental Lexicon	SEP 03, 1998	UNIV ALBERTA, EDMONTON, CANADA		UNIV ALBERTA			Current models of spoken word recognition take into account factors such as word frequency, word onset cohort size, and phonological neighborhood density. Using the word onset gating technique we tested word recognition when bandpass filtering was used to allow subjects to hear the full prosodic pattern of a word (number of syllables and syllabic stress), deprived of segmental information beyond that contained in the onset gate. Subjects also heard either word onsets plus duration information or only word onsets. Results suggest that word prosody is represented in the mental lexicon and is effectively used by listeners in spoken word recognition.

We propose three principles as those operating in the selection of the appropriate Chinese characters in writing unknown place names. The three principles are concerned with the combination of on and kun readings (zyuubako-yomi), the number of segmentations. and the bimoraicity characteristics of kanji chosen. We performed two experiments to test the principles: the results supported our hypotheses. These results have some implications for the structure of the Japanese mental lexicon, for the processing load in the use of Chinese characters, and for Japanese prosody and morphology.												0	0											MAR	2001	30	2					135	145		10.1023/A:1010373727869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010373727869												2026-01-16	WOS:000168772000002
J	Koester, D				Koester, Dirk			Prosody in parsing morphologically complex words: Neurophysiological evidence	COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY				Article								Little is known about the neurophysiological correlates of lexical prosody in the comprehension of compound words, i.e., morphologically complex words. Here, it is investigated whether lexical prosody influences the decomposition of spoken compound words. In order to explore the neurophysiological correlates (event-related potentials, ERP) of a compound prosody, German native speakers had to judge the number agreement between numerals and nouns which did or did not agree in 50% of the cases. Importantly, the nouns carried either a compound or non-compound (single noun) prosody. The compound prosody led to increased reaction times (RTs) and reduced judgement accuracy. Critically, number violations for words with a compound prosody elicited an increased ERP negativity that was delayed by about 600ms relative to a left-anterior negativity elicited by number violations for a single noun prosody. The ERP effect for the compound prosody preceded the according behavioural response by about 200ms and the ERP peak latency effect correlated with the RT effect. These findings suggest that the ERP effect for the compound prosody could be functionally related to the accurate judgement performance for the compound prosody. The results suggest, more generally, that prosody plays a critical role in auditory compound comprehension and morphological processing.												3	5											FEB 17	2014	31	1-2			SI		147	163		10.1080/02643294.2013.857649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02643294.2013.857649												2026-01-16	WOS:000335196800008
J	Ashby, M				Ashby, Michael			Prosody and idioms in English	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS				Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Prosody and Pragmatics	NOV, 2003	Preston, ENGLAND					English idioms commonly appear to exhibit relatively fixed prosodic patterns, and departure from the expected prosodic pattern can give rise to humorous and bizarre effects. As idioms are generally supposed to require phrasal entries in the mental lexicon, there is some initial plausibility in the proposal that such entries might include arbitrary prosodic or accentual properties. Various categories of idiom can be distinguished, according to which aspects of the prosodic pattern seem to be fixed, and the relationship the pattern bears to those which would be expected on corresponding literal expressions. Nevertheless it is argued that the prosodic patterns of idioms are in reality neither fixed nor arbitrary. The bizarre effects in interpretation result not from deviation from a lexically specified pattern, but from the attempt to introduce focus distinctions into the non-compositional parts of idioms. Implications for psycholinguistic studies of the processing of ambiguous sentences are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Michelas, A; Dufour, S				Michelas, Amandine; Dufour, Sophie			Are Prosodic Variants Stored in the French Mental Lexicon?	EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								A long-term priming experiment examined the way stress information is processed and represented in French speakers' mind. Repeated prime and target words either matched (/ba'do/ - /ba'do/ "headband") or mismatched their stress pattern (/bado/ - /ba'do/). In comparison to a control condition (/makc/ - /ba'do/), the results showed that matching and mismatching primes were equally effective in facilitating the processing of the target words. Thus, despite the fact that French speakers routinely produce and hear words in their stressed and unstressed versions, this study suggests that stress in French is not integrated into lexical representations.												5	6											NOV	2019	66	6					393	401		10.1027/1618-3169/a000462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1618-3169/a000462												2026-01-16	WOS:000514569700002
J	Tucker, BV; Ernestus, M				Tucker, Benjamin V.; Ernestus, Mirjam			Why we need to investigate casual speech to truly understand language production, processing and the mental lexicon	MENTAL LEXICON				Article								The majority of studies addressing psycholinguistic questions focus on speech produced and processed in a careful, laboratory speech style. This 'careful' speech is very different from the speech that listeners encounter in casual conversations. This article argues that research on casual speech is necessary to show the validity of conclusions based on careful speech. Moreover, research on casual speech produces new insights and questions on the processes underlying communication and on the mental lexicon that cannot be revealed by research using careful speech. This article first places research on casual speech in its historic perspective. It then provides many examples of how casual speech differs from careful speech and shows that these differences may have important implications for psycholinguistic theories. Subsequently, the article discusses the challenges that research on casual speech faces, which stem from the high variability of this speech style, its necessary casual context, and that casual speech is connected speech. We also present opportunities for research on casual speech, mostly in the form of new experimental methods that facilitate research on connected speech. However, real progress can only be made if these new methods are combined with advanced (still to be developed) statistical techniques.												29	33												2016	11	3					375	400		10.1075/ml.11.3.03tuc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/ml.11.3.03tuc												2026-01-16	WOS:000391222400003

Theories differ with respect to the abstractness and specification of tone in the mental lexicon. In a forced choice task, we tested Swedish listeners' responses to words with segmentally identical first syllables differing in tonal contours (characterized as Accents 1 and 2). We assumed Accent I to be lexically specified for a subset of words and hypothesized that this specification would speed up word accent identification. As was predicted, listeners were fastest in choosing the tonally correct word when the accent was lexically specified. We conclude that the processing of surface tonal contours is governed by their underlying lexical structure with tonal specification.												9	9											NOV	2009	71	8					1890	1899		10.3758/APP.71.8.1890	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/APP.71.8.1890												2026-01-16	WOS:000272722800017
J	Feizabadi, PS; Bijankhan, M				Feizabadi, Parvin Sadat; Bijankhan, Mahmood			The Effect of Non-sentential Context Prosody on Homographs' Lexical Activation in Persian	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH				Article								This study examines the effect of non-sentential context prosody pattern on lexical activation in Persian. For this purpose a questionnaire including target and non-target words is used. The target words are homographs with two possible stress patterns belonging to different syntactic categories. Participants are asked to read out the words aloud and note the first word that comes to their mind. The results show that by reading the target words, both meanings of the target words are activated in mind and the prosodic pattern of the non-sentential preceding context does not affect the activation of the other stress pattern meaning. This result suggests that the metrical prosodic pattern of non-sentential context is not a strong constraint to determine which meaning of the target word must be activated. The experiment also illustrates that the stress pattern used to read the target words does not necessarily matches the stress pattern of the target word which relates to the written word. These findings confirm Swinney (Verb Learn Verb Behav 18:645-665, 1979) and Elston-Guttler and Friederici's (J Mem Lang 52(2):256-283, 2005) finding that both meanings of an ambiguous word are accessed at the first stage. This study shows that in lack of semantic context, Persian natives behave homographs as ambiguous words and there is no bias towards preferring one meaning over another.												0	0											DEC	2015	44	6					831	838		10.1007/s10936-014-9324-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10936-014-9324-4												2026-01-16	WOS:000363051400011
J	Isel, F; Gunter, TC; Friederici, AD				Isel, F; Gunter, TC; Friederici, AD			Prosody-assisted head-driven access to spoken German compounds	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION				Article								Auditory processing of German 2-noun compound words was investigated with 328 participants in 4 experiments by monitoring semantic priming effects of the left constituents of the compound words. The authors demonstrated that there is no primacy of the left constituents in accessing auditorily presented German compound words in the mental lexicon. A clear priming effect of left constituents occurred only for compound words with a transparent right constituent that is the head of compound words in Germanic languages. The data suggest that the access to German compounds in the auditory domain involves 2 temporally overlapping routes: direct and decompositional. The prosodic structure (i.e., the duration) of the first morphemes of compound words appears to be a determining factor for activation of the decompositional route.												47	54											MAR	2003	29	2					277	288		10.1037/0278-7393.29.2.277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.29.2.277												2026-01-16	WOS:000181875500009
J	Xie, DY; Chen, H; Li, B				Xie, Dongyue; Chen, Hua; Li, Bin			Chunks, pauses, and holistic processing in Mandarin spontaneous speech	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Chunks are multiword sequences with independent meaning and function, or formulaic based on the intuition of native speakers, hypothesized to be holistically restored and retrieved in the mental lexicon. Previous studies suggest that pauses and intonational boundaries tend to occur at the boundaries of chunks, but less discussion was made on the influence of chunk categories over mental processing and on pause placement associated with intonational continuity. This study adopted spontaneous monologs of Mandarin natives in formal and informal settings. It examined the co-occurrence of chunks and pause-defined processing units and pause placement around chunks to explore to what extent chunks are holistically processed. The results showed that Mandarin chunks were likely to be situated within a single processing unit, indicating chunks as smaller units than processing units in spontaneous speech. Major chunk categories exhibited significantly different patterns in co-occurring with processing units, indicating the influence of chunk properties on the mental processing of chunks. In addition, chunks tended to be fluently processed in spontaneous speech production as fewer hesitations occurred before and during chunk production. Major chunk categories shared a similar threshold in encountering hesitations before chunk production and differed significantly in hesitation distribution during chunk production. Hesitations in the middle of chunks were more likely to be situated within intonation units compared to those before chunk production. Speakers' effort to maintain the intonational continuity of chunks when they encounter processing difficulties reveals the mental reality of the holistic nature of chunks. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of chunks and processing units differed significantly between the formal and informal speech genres, indicating genre influence on the mental processing of chunks. Altogether, the findings of this study have provided implications for theories on chunks and the syntactic-prosody interface and contributed to implications for the design of Mandarin instructions and teaching.												0	0											FEB 16	2023	14								1071729	10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1071729	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1071729												2026-01-16	WOS:000953435000001
J	Roll, M; Horne, M; Lindgren, M				Roll, Mikael; Horne, Merle; Lindgren, Magnus			Word accents and morphology-ERPs of Swedish word processing	BRAIN RESEARCH				Article								Results indicating that high stem tones realizing word accents activate a certain class of suffixes in online processing of Central Swedish are presented. This supports the view that high Swedish word accent tones are induced onto word stems by particular suffixes rather than being associated with words in the mental lexicon. Using event-related potentials, effects of mismatch between word accents and inflectional suffixes were compared with mismatches between stem and suffix in terms of declension class. Declensionally incorrect suffixes yielded an increase in the N400, indicating problems in lexical retrieval, as well as a P600 effect, showing reanalysis. Both declensionally correct and incorrect high tone-inducing (Accent 2) suffixes combined with a mismatching low tone (Accent 1) on the stems produced P600 effects, but did not increase the N400. Suffixes usually co-occurring with Accent 1 did not yield any effects in words realized with the nonmatching Accent 2, suggesting that Accent 1 is a default accent, lacking association with any particular suffix. High tones on Accent 2 words also produced an early anterior positivity, interpreted as a P200 effect reflecting preattentive processing of the tone. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Inferring Difficulty: Flexibility in the Real-time Processing of Disfluency	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Upon hearing a disfluent referring expression, listeners expect the speaker to refer to an object that is previously unmentioned, an object that does not have a straightforward label, or an object that requires a longer description. Two visual-world eye-tracking experiments examined whether listeners directly associate disfluency with these properties of objects, or whether disfluency attribution is more flexible and involves situation-specific inferences. Since in natural situations reference to objects that do not have a straightforward label or that require a longer description is correlated with both production difficulty and with disfluency, we used a mini-artificial lexicon to dissociate difficulty from these properties, building on the fact that recently learned names take longer to produce than existing words in one's mental lexicon. The results demonstrate that disfluency attribution involves situation-specific inferences; we propose that in new situations listeners spontaneously infer what may cause production difficulty. However, the results show that these situation-specific inferences are limited in scope: listeners assessed difficulty relative to their own experience with the artificial names, and did not adapt to the assumed knowledge of the speaker.												23	25											JUN	2015	58	2					190	203		10.1177/0023830914528107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830914528107												2026-01-16	WOS:000354864700004
J	McQueen, JM; Cutler, A; Norris, D				McQueen, JM; Cutler, A; Norris, D			Flow of information in the spoken word recognition system	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								Spoken word recognition consists of two major component processes. First, at the prelexical stage, an abstract description of the utterance is generated from the information in the speech signal. Second, at the lexical stage, this description is used to activate all the words stored in the mental lexicon which match the input. These multiple candidate words then compete with each other. We review evidence which suggests that positive (match) and negative (mismatch) information of both a segmental and a suprasegmental nature is used to constrain this activation and competition process. We then ask whether, in addition to the necessary influence of the prelexical stage on the lexical stage, there is also feedback from the lexicon to the prelexical level. In two phonetic categorization experiments, Dutch listeners were asked to label both syllable-initial and syllable-final ambiguous fricatives (e.g., sounds ranging from [f] to [s]) in the word-nonword series maf-mas, and the nonword-word series jaf-jas. They tended to label the sounds in a lexically consistent manner (i.e., consistent with the word endpoints of the series). These lexical effects became smaller in listeners' slower responses, even when the listeners were put under pressure to respond as fast as possible. Our results challenge models of spoken word recognition in which feedback modulates the prelexical analysis of the component sounds of a word whenever that word is heard.

J	Zora, H; Riad, T; Ylinen, S				Zora, Hatice; Riad, Tomas; Ylinen, Sari			Prosodically controlled derivations in the mental lexicon	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS				Article								Swedish morphemes are classified as prosodically specified or prosodically unspecified, depending on lexical or phonological stress, respectively. Here, we investigate the allomorphy of the suffix -(i)sk, which indicates the distinction between lexical and phonological stress; if attached to a lexically stressed morpheme, it takes a non-syllabic form (-sk), whereas if attached to a phonologically stressed morpheme, an epenthetic vowel is inserted (-isk). Using mismatch negativity (MMN), we explored the neural processing of this allomorphy across lexically stressed and phonologically stressed morphemes. In an oddball paradigm, participants were occasionally presented with congruent and incongruent derivations, created by the suffix -(i)sk, within the repetitive presentation of their monomorphemic stems. The results indicated that the congruent derivation of the lexically stressed stem elicited a larger MMN than the incongruent sequences of the same stem and the derivational suffix, whereas after the phonologically stressed stem a non-significant tendency towards an opposite pattern was observed. We argue that the significant MMN response to the congruent derivation in the lexical stress condition is in line with lexical MMN, indicating a holistic processing of the sequence of lexically stressed stem and derivational suffix. The enhanced MMN response to the incongruent derivation in the phonological stress condition, on the other hand, is suggested to reflect combinatorial processing of the sequence of phonologically stressed stem and derivational suffix. These findings bring a new aspect to the dual-system approach to neural processing of morphologically complex words, namely the specification of word stress.												8	8											NOV	2019	52								100856	10.1016/j.jneuroling.2019.100856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroling.2019.100856												2026-01-16	WOS:000483452600007
J	Defterdarevic-Muradbegovic, A				Defterdarevic-Muradbegovic, Almasa			PHONETIC WORD - A BASIS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND LEARNING THE SPOKEN FRENCH	GOVOR				Article								Long ago sociolinguists have indicated that variability is the essential feature of language nature. It is difficult to speak about the ideal spoken form. There are only realised spoken forms, and the criteria for their evaluation depend on the native speakers' Judgement. The standard pronunciation does not always mean the same realisation, the same acoustic utterance form. Those who use a foreign language today must be able to understand the natural speech, but also try hard to speak as naturally as possible so as to be treated as equal partners in verbal communication. In connected speech specific categories of prosodic features are manifested The relevant domains of realisation of these features are syllable, foot, phonetic word, intonation group, utterance. All the mentioned levels change significantly the canonical acoustic word forms as are usually stored in the mental lexicon of foreign language learners. The paper draws particular attention to the role of phonetic word both in understanding (with regard to the fluent speech segmentation problem) and in connecting individual words into accentual speech units. Phonetic word in French pronunciation may be regarded as the natural context for mastering most pronunciation phenomena. Segment phonotactics in syllable constituents can be most adequately presented within phonetic word Resyllabifications, which are traditionally marked as "enchainement" and "liaison", occur within this unit. Hierarchical and rhythmic, as well as melodic, syllable organisation is also realised in phonetic word. Particular attention should be paid to the final, accented, in articulatory terms the most organised phonetic word syllable, due to its linguistic relevance and perceptual saliency. The elision of the French "potential" schwa leads not only to the reduction of the number of syllables of the given phonetic word, but also to assimilation in consonant clusters at word edges within phonetic word, often creating in that way consonant clusters atypical of the French phonotactics, and even segments atypical of the language. Within phonetic word, but at its end too, occur many elisions and simplifications of consonant clusters, typical of standard informal speech in particular.												1	1												2008	25	1					3	30															2026-01-16	WOS:000260074700001
