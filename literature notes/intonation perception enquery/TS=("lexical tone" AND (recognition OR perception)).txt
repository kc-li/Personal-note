Jung; Lin, Yung-Song			The effect of lexical tone experience on English intonation perception in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children	MEDICINE				Article								To examine the effect of lexical tone experience on English intonation perception in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children during second language acquisition in Taiwan. A retrospective cohort study. A tertiary referred center. Fourteen children with cochlear implant (CI) in the experimental group, and 9 normal hearing children in the control group were enrolled in this study. Cochlear implantation and hearing rehabilitation. Two speech recognition accuracies were examined: (1) Lexical tone recognition (4-alternative forced choice, AFC), (2) English Sentence Intonation (2AFC). The overall accuracies for tone perception are 61.13% (standard deviation, SD = 10.84%) for CI group and 93.82% (SD = 1.80%) for normal hearing group. Tone 4 and Tone 1 were more easily to be recognized than tone 2 and tone 3 in the pediatric CI recipients (cCI) group. In English intonation perception, the overall accuracies are 61.82% (SD = 16.85%) for CI group, and 97.59% (SD = 4.73%) for normal hearing group. Significant high correlation (R = .919, P <= .000) between lexical tone perception and English intonation perception is noted. There is no significant difference for English intonation perception accuracies between Mandarin-speaking cCI (61.82%) and English-speaking cCI (70.13%, P = .11). Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children showed significant deficits in perception of lexical tone and English intonation relative to normal hearing children. There was no tonal language benefit in Mandarin-speaking cochlear-implanted children's English intonation perception, compared to the English-speaking cochlear-implanted peers. For cochlear-implanted children, better lexical tone perception comes with better English intonation perception. Enhancing Mandarin prosodic perception for cochlear-implanted children may benefit their command of intonation in English.												2	2											JUL 15	2022	101	28							e29567	10.1097/MD.0000000000029567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029567												2026-01-16	WOS:000825571400034

Design: Lexical tone perception and melodic contour identification (MCI) were measured in 21 prelingual and 11 postlingual young (aged 6-26 years) Mandarin-speaking CI users. Lexical tone recognition was measured for four tonal patterns: tone 1 (flat F0), tone 2 (rising F0), tone 3 (falling-rising F0), and tone 4 (falling F0). MCI was measured using nine five-note melodic patterns that contained changes in pitch contour, as well as different semitone spacing between notes. Results: Lexical tone recognition was generally good (overall mean = 81% correct), and there was no significant difference between subject groups. MCI performance was generally poor (mean = 23% correct). MCI performance was significantly better for postlingual (mean = 32% correct) than for prelingual CI participants (mean = 18% correct). After correcting for outliers, there was no significant correlation between lexical tone recognition and MCI performance for prelingual or postlingual CI participants. Age at deafness was significantly correlated with MCI performance only for postlingual participants. CI experience was significantly correlated with MCI performance for both prelingual and postlingual participants. Duration of deafness was significantly correlated with tone recognition only for prelingual participants. Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of pitch cues in Mandarin, the present CI participants had great difficulty perceiving melodic pitch. The availability of amplitude and duration cues in lexical tones most likely compensated for the poor pitch perception observed with these CI listeners. Previous acoustic hearing experience seemed to benefit postlingual CI users' melodic pitch perception. Longer CI experience was associated with better MCI performance for both subject groups, suggesting that CI users' music perception may improve as they gain experience with their device.												38	51											JAN	2015	36	1					102	110		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000086												2026-01-16	WOS:000346911200011
J	Tong, XL; Tong, XH; McBride-Chang, C				Tong, Xiuli; Tong, Xiuhong; McBride-Chang, Catherine			Tune in to the Tone: Lexical Tone Identification is Associated with Vocabulary and Word Recognition Abilities in Young Chinese Children	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Lexical tone is one of the most prominent features in the phonological representation of words in Chinese. However, little, if any, research to date has directly evaluated how young Chinese children's lexical tone identification skills contribute to vocabulary acquisition and character recognition. The present study distinguished lexical tones from segmental phonological awareness and morphological awareness in order to estimate the unique contribution of lexical tone in early vocabulary acquisition and character recognition. A sample of 199 Cantonese children aged 5-6 years was assessed on measures of lexical tone identification, segmental phonological awareness, morphological awareness, nonverbal ability, vocabulary knowledge, and Chinese character recognition. It was found that lexical tone awareness and morphological awareness were both associated with vocabulary knowledge and character recognition. However, there was a significant relationship between lexical tone awareness and both vocabulary knowledge and character recognition, even after controlling for the effects of age, nonverbal ability, segmental phonological awareness and morphological awareness. These findings suggest that lexical tone is a key factor accounting for individual variance in young children's lexical acquisition in Chinese, and that lexical tone should be considered in understanding how children learn new Chinese vocabulary words, in either oral or written forms.												29	31											DEC	2015	58	4					441	458		10.1177/0023830914562988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830914562988												2026-01-16	WOS:000367472500002
J	Chen, YF; Yang, Y; Zhang, XY; Chen, F				Chen, Yufeng; Yang, Yu; Zhang, Xueying; Chen, Fei			Meta-analysis on lexical tone recognition in cochlear implant users	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY				Review								ObjectiveLexical tone plays a vital role in speech communication in tonal languages. This study investigated lexical tone recognition in cochlear implant (CI) users, and identified potential factors that influence lexical tone recognition in the CI population.DesignWe conducted a systematic search across eleven major databases, evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies, and conducted five meta-analyses.Study sampleForty studies that utilised a multi-item alternative forced-choice paradigm were included to evaluate the performance of lexical tone recognition in CI users.ResultsCI users performed worse at recognising lexical tones than normal hearing (NH) controls. Furthermore, bimodal stimulation could benefit lexical tone recognition for CI users in both quiet and noisy conditions. Besides, the pooled results showed a negative correlation between tone recognition accuracy and age at implantation, as well as a positive correlation between tone recognition performance and the duration of CI experience.ConclusionsThis study indicates that CI users could not recognise lexical tones at the same level as the NH population. The bimodal intervention does have a more positive effect than unimodal implantation regardless of the listening environment. Moreover, earlier implantation and longer experience with the CI could facilitate lexical tone recognition.												2	2											JUN 2	2025	64	6					557	569		10.1080/14992027.2025.2456003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2025.2456003		JAN 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001410864300001
J	Liang, BS; Du, Y				Liang, Baishen; Du, Yi			The Functional Neuroanatomy of Lexical Tone Perception: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Review								In tonal language such as Chinese, lexical tone serves as a phonemic feature in determining word meaning. Meanwhile, it is close to prosody in terms of suprasegmental pitch variations and larynx-based articulation. The important yet mixed nature of lexical tone has evoked considerable studies, but no consensus has been reached on its functional neuroanatomy. This meta-analysis aimed at uncovering the neural network of lexical tone perception in comparison with that of phoneme and prosody in a unified framework. Independent Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analyses were conducted for different linguistic elements: lexical tone by native tonal language speakers, lexical tone by non-tonal language speakers, phoneme, word-level prosody, and sentence-level prosody. Results showed that lexical tone and prosody studies demonstrated more extensive activations in the right than the left auditory cortex, whereas the opposite pattern was found for phoneme studies. Only tonal language speakers consistently recruited the left anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) for processing lexical tone, an area implicated in phoneme processing and word-form recognition. Moreover, an anterior-lateral to posterior-medial gradient of activation as a function of element timescale was revealed in the right STG, in which the activation for lexical tone lied between that for phoneme and that for prosody. Another topological pattern was shown on the left precentral gyrus (preCG), with the activation for lexical tone overlapped with that for prosody but ventral to that for phoneme. These findings provide evidence that the neural network for lexical tone perception is hybrid with those for phoneme and prosody. That is, resembling prosody, lexical tone perception, regardless of language experience, involved right auditory cortex, with activation localized between sites engaged by phonemic and prosodic processing, suggesting a hierarchical organization of representations in the right auditory cortex. For tonal language speakers, lexical tone additionally engaged the left STG lexical mapping network, consistent with the phonemic representation. Similarly, when processing lexical tone, only tonal language speakers engaged the left preCG site implicated in prosody perception, consistent with tonal language speakers having stronger articulatory representations for lexical tone in the laryngeal sensorimotor network. A dynamic dual-stream model for lexical tone perception was proposed and discussed.												50	53											JUL 24	2018	12								495	10.3389/fnins.2018.00495	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00495												2026-01-16	WOS:000439602900001

Using a speeded discrimination paradigm free of context information, we confirmed multiple lines of evidence for the lexical tone disadvantage as well as revealed a distinctive advantage of word and atonal syllable judgments over phoneme and lexical tone judgments. The results led us to propose a Reverse Accessing Model (RAM) for tonal speech perception. The RAM is an extension of the influential TRACE model, with two additional processing levels specialized for tonal speech: lexical tone and atonal syllable. Critically, information accessing is assumed to be in reverse order of information processing, and only information at the syllable level and up is maintained active for immediate use. We tested and confirmed the predictions of the RAM on discrimination of each type of phonological component under different stimulus conditions. The current results have thus demonstrated the capability of the RAM as a general framework for tonal speech perception to provide a united account for empirical observations as well as to generate testable predictions.												11	12											DEC 18	2019	10								2830	10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02830	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02830												2026-01-16	WOS:000505028100001
J	Chen, A; Stevens, CJ; Kager, R				Chen, Ao; Stevens, Catherine J.; Kager, Rene			Pitch Perception in the First Year of Life, a Comparison of Lexical Tones and Musical Pitch	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Pitch variation is pervasive in speech, regardless of the language to which infants are exposed. Lexical tone is influenced by general sensitivity to pitch. We examined whether the development in lexical tone perception may develop in parallel with perception of pitch in other cognitive domains namely music. Using a visual fixation paradigm, 100 and one 4- and 12-month-old Dutch infants were tested on their discrimination of Chinese rising and dipping lexical tones as well as comparable three-note musical pitch contours. The 4-month-old infants failed to show a discrimination effect in either condition, whereas the 12-month-old infants succeeded in both conditions. These results suggest that lexical tone perception may reflect and relate to general pitch perception abilities, which may serve as a basis for developing more complex language and musical skills.												33	36											MAR 9	2017	8								297	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00297	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00297												2026-01-16	WOS:000395787000001

The aim of this review was to identify potential factors that determine outcomes for tonal-language speaking cochlear implant users and possible directions for further research. Method: A computerized database search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was undertaken in June and July 2014. Search terms used were lexical tone AND tonal language, speech development AND/OR speech production AND/OR speech perception AND cochlear implants, and pitch perception AND cochlear implants, anywhere in the title or abstract. Conclusion: Despite the demonstrated limitations of pitch perception in cochlear implant users, there is some evidence that typical production and perception of lexical tone is possible by cochlear implant users with prelingual deafness. Further studies are required to determine the factors that contribute to better outcomes to inform rehabilitation processes for cochlear implant users in tonal-language environments.												23	24											SEP	2016	25	3					246	256		10.1044/2016_AJA-15-0069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2016_AJA-15-0069												2026-01-16	WOS:000384230400009

Objective: To evaluate the effects of increasing the number of total spectral channels on the lexical tone identification and consonant recognition by normally hearing listeners who are native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Subjects and methods: Lexical tone identification and consonant recognition were measured in 15 Mandarin-speaking, normal-hearing (NH) listeners with varied numbers of total spectral channels (i.e. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24), using acoustic simulations of CIs. Results: The group of NH listeners' performance of lexical tone identification ranged from 44.53% to 66.60% with 4-24 spectral channels. The performance of tone identification between channels 4 and 16 remained similar; between channels 16 and 20 performance improved significantly. As regards consonant recognition, the NH listeners' overall accuracy ranged from 73.17% to 95.33% with 4-24 channels. Steady improvement in consonant recognition accuracy was observed as a function of increasing the spectral channels. With about 12-16 spectral channels, the NH listeners' overall accuracy in consonant recognition began to be comparable to their accuracy with the unprocessed stimuli.												4	5												2009	129	6					630	637	PII 907479731	10.1080/00016480802032793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016480802032793												2026-01-16	WOS:000266080800007

This mini review discusses several factors that might facilitate the disaggregation of referential and affective pitch in infancy: acoustic characteristics of infant-directed speech, recognition of vocal affect, facial cues accompanying affective prosody, and lateralization of affective and referential prosody in the brain.

It has been successful in providing improved speech perception outcomes, especially in quiet environments. However, speech perception performance within complex environments, lexical tone recognition, and music perception have been shown to only improve with newer fine structure coding strategies or related techniques. Therefore, the methods used to assess hearing performance in noisy environments, lexical tone recognition, and music perception are of vital importance. These assessments must reflect the postoperative outcomes and also provide guidance for the programming, rehabilitation, and application of new coding strategies. In this study, hearing performance in simple and complex situations was evaluated before and after upgrading to a fine structure strategy. The participants were a cohort of Mandarin-speaking adolescents, who were experienced CI users. The comprehensive clinical workflow involved assessments of speech in quiet conditions, speech in noisy conditions, lexical tone recognition, and music perception. This battery of tests is explained in detail, from the coding strategy to the test methods, including the test process, environment, device, material, and order. The details that require special attention are discussed, such as the position of the participants, the angle of the loudspeaker, the intensity of the sound, the noise type, the practice test, and the way of answering questions. Each test step, method, and material for speech, lexical tone, and music perception is presented in detail. Finally, the clinical results are discussed.												2	2											MAR	2023		193								10.3791/64552	http://dx.doi.org/10.3791/64552												2026-01-16	WOS:000971111100003

Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Twenty normal-hearing and 21 adult cochlear implant users participated in the Musical Sounds in Cochlear Implants (MuSIC) perception test, including six objective and two subjective musical subtests. The comparison of music perception performance was made between normal-hearing and cochlear implant subjects. Sixteen of the 21 cochlear implant users also performed a tone identification test to investigate the correlation between music and tone perception. Results: Cochlear implant users performed significantly worse than normal-hearing subjects on pitch discrimination, instrument identification, and instrument detection tests, whereas close to normal-hearing subjects on melody discrimination, chords discrimination, rhythm discrimination, and emotion and dissonance rating subtests. Lexical tone perception was significantly correlated with pitch discrimination, melody discrimination, and instrument identification tests. Duration of hearing aid use was found to be correlated with pitch discrimination ability of cochlear implant users. Conclusions: Chinese postlingually deafened cochlear implant users performed significantly poorer in pitch discrimination and timbre perception tasks than normal-hearing listeners. Lexical tone perception was found to be significantly correlated with music pitch perception, supporting the notion that tone and music perception may share a similar pitch perception mechanism.												33	53											JUN	2012	122	6					1353	1360		10.1002/lary.23271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lary.23271												2026-01-16	WOS:000304711000030
J	Liu, HM; Tsao, FM				Liu, Huei-Mei; Tsao, Feng-Ming			Speech Perception Deficits in Mandarin-Speaking School-Aged Children with Poor Reading Comprehension	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Previous studies have shown that children learning alphabetic writing systems who have language impairment or dyslexia exhibit speech perception deficits. However, whether such deficits exist in children learning logographic writing systems who have poor reading comprehension remains uncertain. To further explore this issue, the present study examined speech perception deficits in Mandarin-speaking children with poor reading comprehension. Two self-designed tasks, consonant categorical perception task and lexical tone discrimination task were used to compare speech perception performance in children (n = 31, age range = 7; 4-10; 2) with poor reading comprehension and an age-matched typically developing group (n = 31, age range = 7; 7-9; 10). Results showed that the children with poor reading comprehension were less accurate in consonant and lexical tone discrimination tasks and perceived speech contrasts less categorically than the matched group. The correlations between speech perception skills (i.e., consonant and lexical tone discrimination sensitivities and slope of consonant identification curve) and individuals' oral language and reading comprehension were stronger than the correlations between speech perception ability and word recognition ability. In conclusion, the results revealed that Mandarin-speaking children with poor reading comprehension exhibit less-categorized speech perception, suggesting that imprecise speech perception, especially lexical tone perception, is essential to account for reading learning difficulties in Mandarin-speaking children.												6	7											DEC 14	2017	8								2144	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02144	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02144												2026-01-16	WOS:000417946900001

Its linguistic consequences have been examined separately for speech intonations and lexical tones. However, in a tonal language such as Chinese, the processing of intonations and lexical tones interacts with each other during online speech perception. Whether and how the musical pitch disorder might affect linguistic pitch processing during online speech perception remains unknown. Method: We investigated this question with intonation (question vs. statement) and lexical tone (rising Tone 2 vs. falling Tone 4) identification tasks using the same set of sentences, comparing behavioral and event -related potential measurements between Mandarin -speaking amusics and matched controls. We specifically focused on the amusics without behavioral lexical tone deficits (the majority, i.e., pure amusics). Results: Results showed that, despite relative to normal performance when tested in word lexical tone test, pure amusics demonstrated inferior recognition than controls during sentence tone and intonation identification. Compared to controls, pure amusics had larger N400 amplitudes in question stimuli during tone task and smaller P600 amplitudes in intonation task. Conclusion: These data indicate that musical pitch disorder affects both tone and intonation processing during sentence processing even for pure amusics, whose lexical tone processing was intact when tested with words.												0	0											APR	2024	67	4					1107	1116		10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00520												2026-01-16	WOS:001244512900006

Methods: Lexical tones were recorded from CI recipients and their peers with normal hearing (NH). Each participant was asked to produce a disyllabic word, yan jing, with which the first syllable was pronounced as Tone 3 (a low dipping tone) while the second syllable was pronounced as Tone 1 (a high level tone, meaning "eyes") or as Tone 4 (a high falling tone, meaning "eyeglasses"). In addition, a parametric manipulation in fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of Tones 1 and 4 used in a lexical tone recognition task in Peng et al. (2017) was adopted to evaluate the perceptual reliance on each dimension. Results: Mixed-effect analyses of duration, intensity, and F0 cues revealed that NH children focused exclusively on marking distinct F0 contours, while CI participants shortened Tone 4 or prolonged Tone 1 to enhance their contrast. In line with these production strategies, NH children relied primarily on F0 cues to identify the two tones, whereas CI children showed greater reliance on duration cues. Moreover, CI participants who placed greater perceptual weight on duration cues also tended to exhibit smaller changes in their F0 production. Conclusion: Pediatric CI recipients appear to contrast the secondary acoustic dimension (duration) in addition to F0 contours for both lexical tone production and perception. These findings suggest that perception and production strategies of lexical tones are well coupled in this pediatric CI population.												22	24											JUN 20	2019	13								639	10.3389/fnins.2019.00639	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00639												2026-01-16	WOS:000472227600001

N.; Qian, Jinyu; Kuehnel, Volker; Christina Voss, Solveig; Chen, Fei			The Role of Lexical Tone Information in the Recognition of Mandarin Sentences in Listeners With Hearing Aids	EAR AND HEARING				Article								Objectives: Lexical tone information provides redundant cues for the recognition of Mandarin sentences in listeners with normal hearing in quiet conditions. The contribution of lexical tones to Mandarin sentence recognition in listeners with hearing aids (HAs) is unclear. This study aimed to remove lexical tone information and examine the effects on Mandarin sentence intelligibility in HA users. The second objective was to investigate the contribution of cognitive abilities (i.e., general cognitive ability, working memory, and attention) on Mandarin sentence perception when the presentation of lexical tone information was mismatched. Design: A text-to-speech synthesis engine was used to manipulate Mandarin sentences into three test conditions: (1) a Normal Tone test condition, where no alterations were made to lexical tones within sentences; (2) a Flat Tone test condition, where lexical tones were all changed into tone 1 (i.e., the flat tone); and (3) a Random Tone test condition, where each word in test sentences was randomly assigned one of four Mandarin lexical tones. The manipulated sentence signals were presented to 32 listeners with HAs in both quiet and noisy environments at an 8 dB signal to noise ratio. Results: Speech intelligibility was reduced significantly (by approximately 40 percentage points) in the presence of mismatched lexical tone information in both quiet and noise. The difficulty in correctly identifying sentences with mismatched lexical tones among adults with hearing loss was significantly greater than that of adults with normal hearing. Cognitive function was not significantly related to a decline in speech recognition scores. Conclusions: Contextual and other phonemic cues (i.e., consonants and vowels) are inadequate for HA users to perceive sentences with mismatched lexical tone contours in quiet or noise. Also, HA users with better cognitive function could not compensate for the loss of lexical tone information. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing lexical tone information for Mandarin speakers using HAs.												8	9											MAY-JUN	2020	41	3					532	538		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000774	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000774												2026-01-16	WOS:000530368100007
J	Morett, LM				Morett, Laura M.			The Influence of Tonal and Atonal Bilingualism on Children's Lexical and Non-Lexical Tone Perception	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study examined how bilingualism in an atonal language, in addition to a tonal language, influences lexical and non-lexical tone perception and word learning during childhood. Forty children aged 5;3-7;2, bilingual either in English and Mandarin or English and another atonal language, were tested on Mandarin lexical tone discrimination, level-pitch sine-wave tone discrimination, and learning of novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone. Mandarin-English bilingual children discriminated between and learned novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone more accurately than their atonal-English bilingual peers. However, Mandarin-English and atonal-English bilingual children discriminated between level-pitch sine-wave tones with similar accuracy. Moreover, atonal-English bilingual children showed a tendency to perceive differing Mandarin lexical and level-pitch sine-wave tones as identical, whereas their Mandarin-English peers showed no such tendency. These results indicate that bilingualism in a tonal language in addition to an atonal language-but not bilingualism in two atonal languages-allows for continued sensitivity to lexical tone beyond infancy. Moreover, they suggest that although tonal-atonal bilingualism does not enhance sensitivity to differences in pitch between sine-wave tones beyond infancy any more effectively than atonal-atonal bilingualism, it protects against the development of biases to perceive differing lexical and non-lexical tones as identical. Together, the results indicate that, beyond infancy, tonal-atonal bilinguals process lexical tones using different cognitive mechanisms than atonal-atonal bilinguals, but that both groups process level-pitch non-lexical tone using the same cognitive mechanisms.												7	8											JUN	2020	63	2					221	241		10.1177/0023830919834679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830919834679												2026-01-16	WOS:000537760600002

N.; Hu, Yi			Effects of Lexical Tone Contour on Mandarin Sentence Intelligibility	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: This study examined the effects of lexical tone contour on the intelligibility of Mandarin sentences in quiet and in noise. Method: A text-to-speech synthesis engine was used to synthesize Mandarin sentences with each word carrying the original lexical tone, flat tone, or a tone randomly selected from the 4 Mandarin lexical tones. The synthesized speech signals were presented to 11 normal-hearing listeners for recognition in quiet and in speech-shaped noise at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Results: Normal-hearing listeners nearly perfectly recognized the Mandarin sentences produced with modified tone contours in quiet; however, performance declined substantially in noise. Conclusions: Consistent with previous findings to some extent, the present findings suggest that lexical tones are relatively redundant cues for Mandarin sentence intelligibility in quiet and that other cues could compensate for the distorted lexical tone contour. However, in noise, the results provide direct evidence that lexical tone contour is important for the recognition of Mandarin sentences.												67	79											FEB	2014	57	1					338	345		10.1044/1092-4388(2013/12-0324)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2013/12-0324)												2026-01-16	WOS:000347919100027
J	Xu, L; Pfingst, BE				Xu, L; Pfingst, BE			Relative importance of temporal envelope and fine structure in lexical-tone perception	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								The relative importance of temporal envelope and fine structure in speech and music perception was investigated by Smith et al. [Nature (London) 416, 87-90 (2002)] using "auditory chimera" in which the envelope from one sound was paired with the fine structure of another. Smith et al. found that, when 4 to 16 frequency bands were used, recognition of English speech was dominated by the envelope, whereas recognition of melody was dominated by the fine structure. In the present study, Mandarin Chinese monosyllables were divided into 4, 8, or 16 frequency bands and the tine structure and envelope of one tone pattern were exchanged with those of another tone pattern of the same monosyllable. Five normal-hearing native Mandarin Chinese speakers completed a four-alternative forced-choice tone-identification task. In the vast majority of trials, subjects based their identification of the monosyllables on the fine structure rather than the envelope. Thus, the relative importance of envelope and fine structure for lexical-tone perception resembled that for melody recognition rather than that for English speech recognition. Delivering fine-structure information in cochlear implant stimulation could be particularly beneficial for lexical-tone perception.

Listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) have an impaired ability to use FS in lexical tone perception due to the reduced frequency resolution. Listeners with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) may have deficits in temporal resolution. Little is known about how such deficits may impact their ability to use E and FS to perceive lexical tone, and whether it is the deficit in temporal resolution or frequency resolution that may lead to more detrimental effects on FS processing in pitch perception. Three experiments were conducted in the present study. Experiment I used the "auditory chimera" technique to investigate how SNHL and ANSD listeners would achieve lexical tone recognition using either the E or the FS cues. Experiment II tested their frequency resolution as measured with their psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs). Experiment III tested their temporal resolution as measured with the temporal gap detection (TGD) threshold. The results showed that the SNHL listeners had reduced frequency selectivity, but intact temporal resolution ability, while the ANSD listeners had degraded temporal resolution ability, but intact frequency selectivity. In comparison with the SNHL listeners, the ANSD listeners had severely degraded ability to process the FS cues and thus their ability to perceive lexical tone mainly depended on the ability to use the E cues. These results suggested that, in comparison with the detrimental impact of the reduced frequency selectivity, the impaired temporal resolution may lead to more degraded FS processing in pitch perception.												1	1												2016	894						241	248		10.1007/978-3-319-25474-6_25	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25474-6_25	10.1007/978-3-319-25474-6											2026-01-16	WOS:000385741400026
J	Zhu, SF; Wong, LLN; Wang, B; Chen, F				Zhu, Shufeng; Wong, Lena L. N.; Wang, Bin; Chen, Fei			Assessing the Importance of Lexical Tone Contour to Sentence Perception in Mandarin-Speaking Children With Normal Hearing	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of lexical tone contour and age on sentence perception in quiet and in noise conditions in Mandarin-speaking children ages 7 to 11 years with normal hearing. Method: Test materials were synthesized Mandarin sentences, each word with a manipulated lexical contour, that is, normal contour, flat contour, or a tone contour randomly selected from the four Mandarin lexical tone contours. A convenience sample of 75 Mandarin-speaking participants with normal hearing, ages 7, 9, and 11 years (25 participants in each age group), was selected. Participants were asked to repeat the synthesized speech in quiet and in speech spectrum-shaped noise at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Results: In quiet, sentence recognition by the 11-year-old children was similar to that of adults, and misrepresented lexical tone contours did not have a detrimental effect. However, the performance of children ages 9 and 7 years was significantly poorer. The performance of all three age groups, especially the younger children, declined significantly in noise. Conclusions: The present research suggests that lexical tone contour plays an important role in Mandarin sentence recognition, and misrepresented tone contours result in greater difficulty in sentence recognition in younger children. These results imply that maturation and/or language use experience play a role in the processing of tone contours for Mandarin speech understanding, particularly in noise.												3	4											JUL	2017	60	7					2116	2123		10.1044/2017_JSLHR-H-16-0272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2017_JSLHR-H-16-0272												2026-01-16	WOS:000408948100021

Previous studies with OPAL have explored performance on speech and lexical tone perception in Mandarin- and English-speaking CI recipients. However, it was not clear which cues to lexical tone (primary and/or secondary) were used by the Mandarin CI listeners. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate whether OPAL provides improved recognition of Mandarin lexical tones in both quiet and noisy environments compared with the Advanced Combination Encoder (ACE) strategy. A secondary aim was to investigate whether, and to what extent, removal of secondary (duration and intensity envelope) cues to lexical tone affected Mandarin tone perception.Design:Thirty-two CI recipients with an average age of 24 (range 7 to 57) years were enrolled in the study. All recipients had at least 1 year of experience using ACE. Each subject attended two testing sessions, the first to measure baseline performance, and the second to evaluate the effect of strategy after provision of some take-home experience using OPAL. A minimum take-home duration of approximately 4 weeks was prescribed in which subjects were requested to use OPAL as much as possible but were allowed to also use ACE when needed. The evaluation tests included recognition of Mandarin lexical tones in quiet and in noise (signal to noise ratio [SNR] +5 dB) using naturally produced tones and duration/intensity envelope normalized versions of the tones; Mandarin sentence in adaptive noise; Mandarin monosyllabic and disyllabic word in quiet; a subset of Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of hearing questionnaire (SSQ, speech hearing scale); and subjective preference for strategy in quiet and noise.Results:For both the natural and normalized lexical tone tests, mean scores for OPAL were significantly higher than ACE in quiet by 2.7 and 2.9%-points, respectively, and in noise by 7.4 and 7.2%-points, respectively. Monosyllabic word recognition in quiet using OPAL was significantly higher than ACE by approximately 7.5% points. Average SSQ ratings for OPAL were significantly higher than ACE by approximately 0.5 points on a 10-point scale. In quiet conditions, 14 subjects preferred OPAL, 7 expressed a preference for ACE, and 9 reported no preference. Compared with quiet, in noisy situations, there was a stronger preference for OPAL (19 recipients), a similar preference for ACE (7 recipients), while fewer expressed no preference. Average daily take-home use of ACE and OPAL was 4.9 and 7.1 hr, respectively.Conclusions:For Mandarin-speaking CI recipients, OPAL provided significant improvements to lexical tone perception for natural and normalized tones in quiet and noise, monosyllabic word recognition in quiet, and subjective ratings of speech intelligibility. Subjects accessed both primary and secondary cues to lexical tone for perception in quiet and noise conditions. The benefits of lexical tone recognition were attributed to enhanced F0 rate cues encoded by OPAL, especially in a noisy environment. The OPAL strategy was well accepted by many of the Mandarin-speaking CI recipients.												0	0											JAN-FEB	2025	46	1					210	222		10.1097/AUD.0000000000001572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000001572												2026-01-16	WOS:001378941800013
J	Gao, Q; Wong, LLN; Chen, F				Gao, Qi; Wong, Lena L. N.; Chen, Fei			A Review of Speech Perception of Mandarin-Speaking Children With Cochlear Implantation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Review								Objective: This paper reviewed the literature on the development of and factors affecting speech perception of Mandarin-speaking children with cochlear implantation (CI). We also summarized speech outcome measures in standard Mandarin for evaluating auditory and speech perception of children with CI.Method: A comprehensive search of Google Scholar and PubMed was conducted from March to June 2021. Search terms used were speech perception/lexical tone recognition/auditory perception AND cochlear implant AND Mandarin/Chinese.Conclusion: Unilateral CI recipients demonstrated continuous improvements in auditory and speech perception for several years post-activation. Younger age at implantation and longer duration of CI use contribute to better speech perception. Having undergone a hearing aid trial before implantation and having caregivers whose educational level is higher may lead to better performance. While the findings that support the use of CI to improve speech perception continue to grow, much research is needed to validate the use of unilateral and bilateral implantation. Evidence to date, however, revealed bimodal benefits over CI-only conditions in lexical tone recognition and sentence perception in noise. Due to scarcity of research, conclusions on the benefits of bilateral CIs compared to unilateral CI or bimodal CI use cannot be drawn. Therefore, future research on bimodal and bilateral CIs is needed to guide evidence-based clinical practice.												11	12											DEC 14	2021	15								773694	10.3389/fnins.2021.773694	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.773694												2026-01-16	WOS:000737452900001

However, it remains unclear whether such a suprasegmental phonological processing deficit is due to a difficulty in processing acoustic cues of speech rhythm, such as rise time and intensity. This study set out to investigate to what extent suprasegmental phonological processing (i.e., Cantonese lexical tone perception) and rise time sensitivity could distinguish Chinese children with dyslexia from typically developing children. Sixteen children with dyslexia and 44 age-matched controls were administered a Cantonese lexical tone perception task, psychoacoustic tasks, a nonverbal reasoning ability task, and word reading and dictation tasks. Children with dyslexia performed worse than controls on Cantonese lexical tone perception, rise time, and intensity. Furthermore, Cantonese lexical tone perception appeared to be a stable indicator that distinguishes children with dyslexia from controls, even after controlling for basic auditory processing skills. These findings suggest that suprasegmental phonological processing (i.e., lexical tone perception) is a potential factor that accounts for reading difficulty in Chinese.												15	20											MAY-JUN	2018	51	3					293	301		10.1177/0022219417712018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022219417712018												2026-01-16	WOS:000429878600008
J	Qi, B; Mao, YT; Liu, JX; Liu, B; Xu, L				Qi, Beier; Mao, Yitao; Liu, Jiaxing; Liu, Bo; Xu, Li			Relative contributions of acoustic temporal fine structure and envelope cues for lexical tone perception in noise	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Previous studies have shown that lexical tone perception in quiet relies on the acoustic temporal fine structure (TFS) but not on the envelope (E) cues. The contributions of TFS to speech recognition in noise are under debate. In the present study, Mandarin tone tokens were mixed with speech-shaped noise (SSN) or two-talker babble (TTB) at five signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs; -18 to +6 dB). The TFS and E were then extracted from each of the 30 bands using Hilbert transform. Twenty-five combinations of TFS and E from the sound mixtures of the same tone tokens at various SNRs were created. Twenty normal-hearing, native-Mandarin-speaking listeners participated in the tone-recognition test. Results showed that tone-recognition performance improved as the SNRs in either TFS or E increased. The masking effects on tone perception for the TTB were weaker than those for the SSN. For both types of masker, the perceptual weights of TFS and E in tone perception in noise was nearly equivalent, with E playing a slightly greater role than TFS. Thus, the relative contributions of TFS and E cues to lexical tone perception in noise or in competing-talker maskers differ from those in quiet and those to speech perception of non-tonal languages.

Design: Adult CI recipients were tested on recognition of Mandarin tones in quiet and speech-shaped noise at a signal-to-noise ratio of + 10 dB; Mandarin sentence speech-reception threshold (SRT) in speech-shaped noise; and pitch discrimination of synthetic complex-harmonic tones in quiet. Two versions of the experimental strategy were examined: (OPAL) linear (1: 1) mapping of fundamental frequency (F0) to the coded modulation rate; and (OPAL+) transposed mapping of high F0s to a lower coded rate. Outcomes were compared to results using the clinical ACE (TM) strategy. Study sample: Five Mandarin speaking users of Nucleus (R) cochlear implants. Results: A small but significant benefit in recognition of lexical tones was observed using OPAL compared to ACE in noise, but not in quiet, and not for OPAL+ compared to ACE or OPAL in quiet or noise. Sentence SRTs were significantly better using OPAL+ and comparable using OPAL to those using ACE. No differences in pitch discrimination thresholds were observed across strategies. Conclusions: OPAL can provide benefits to Mandarin lexical tone recognition in moderately noisy conditions and preserve perception of Mandarin sentences in challenging noise conditions.												14	16												2017	56			2			S74	S85		10.1080/14992027.2016.1190872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2016.1190872												2026-01-16	WOS:000416647000009

Y.; Matthews, Stephen; Yakpo, Kofi; Tan, Li Hai			Neural correlates and functional connectivity of lexical tone processing in reading	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								Lexical tone processing in speech is mediated by bilateral superior temporal and inferior prefrontal regions, but little is known concerning the neural circuitries of lexical tone phonology in reading. Using fMRI, we examined the neural systems for lexical tone in visual Chinese word recognition. We found that the extraction of lexical tone phonology in print was subserved by bilateral fronto-parietal regions. Seed-to-voxel analyses showed that functionally connected cortical regions involved right inferior frontal gyrus and SMA, right middle frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule, and SMA and bilateral cingulate gyri. Our results indicate that in Chinese tone reading, a bilateral network of frontal, parietal, motor, and cingulate regions is engaged, without involvement of temporal regions crucial for tone identification in auditory domain. Although neural couplings for lexical tone processing are different in speech and reading to some degree, the motor cortex seems to be a key component independent of modality.												6	7											SEP	2019	196								104662	10.1016/j.bandl.2019.104662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2019.104662												2026-01-16	WOS:000481562400002

J	Wang, R; He, X; Zeng, B				Wang, Rui; He, Xun; Zeng, Biao			Visual Benefit in Lexical Tone Perception in Mandarin: An Event-related Potential Study	NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Congruent visual information enhances auditory speech perception. This visual benefit has been widely observed in perception of consonants and vowels, and linked to reduced amplitudes and latencies of audi -tory N1 and P2 event-related potential (ERP) components when visual information was present. However, it remains unclear whether lexical tone perception in Mandarin also shows this visual benefit. This question is the-oretically important given the low visual saliency of lexical tones. The current study compared the N1/P2 reduc-tion in Mandarin lexical tones and consonants perception with a discrimination task. Result showed amplitude reductions in N1/P2 and a latency reduction in N1 for audiovisual lexical tone perception. These findings suggest that lexical tone perception was also helped by visual information as found in consonants. Furthermore, this visual benefit in N1 for lexical tone perception was delayed relative to consonants. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Else -vier Ltd.

They are pitch patterns expressed by frequency-modulated (FM) signals. Yet, few studies have looked at the relationship between low-level auditory processing of frequency signals and Chinese reading skills. Aims: The study aims to identify the role of auditory frequency processing in Chinese lexical tone awareness as well as character recognition in Chinese-speaking children. Methods: Children with (N = 28) and without (N = 27) developmental dyslexia (DD) were recruited. All participants completed two linguistic tasks, Chinese character recognition and lexical tone awareness, and two auditory frequency processing tasks, frequency discrimination and FM sweep direction identification. Results: The results revealed that Chinese-speaking children with DD were significantly poorer at all tasks. Particularly, Chinese character recognition was significantly related to FM sweep identification. Lexical tone awareness was significantly associated with both auditory frequency processing tasks. Regression analyses suggested the influence of FM sweep identification on Chinese character recognition contributed through lexical tone awareness. Conclusions and implication: This study suggests that poor auditory frequency processing may associate with Chinese developmental dyslexia with phonological deficits. In support of the phonological deficit hypothesis, what underlies phonological deficit is likely to be auditory-basis. A potential clinical implication is to reinforce auditory perception and sensitivity through intervention for phonological processing.												11	13											MAR	2019	86						53	61		10.1016/j.ridd.2019.01.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2019.01.006												2026-01-16	WOS:000458714200006
J	Morett, LM; Chang, LY				Morett, Laura M.; Chang, Li-Yun			Emphasising sound and meaning: pitch gestures enhance Mandarin lexical tone acquisition	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Lexical tones - pitches differentiating between word meanings in tonal languages - are particularly difficult for atonal language speakers to learn. To test the hypotheses of embodied cognition and spoken word recognition, we examined whether - and how - gesture could facilitate English speakers' discrimination between Mandarin words differing in lexical tone. Words were learned with gestures conveying tone pitch contours (pitch gestures), gestures conveying word meanings (semantic gestures) or no gestures. The results demonstrated that pitch gestures enhanced English speakers' discrimination between the meanings of Mandarin words differing in tone, whereas semantic gestures hindered their identification of tones in learned words. These findings indicate that the visuospatial features of pitch gestures strengthen the relationship between English speakers' representations of Mandarin lexical tones and word meanings, supporting the predictions of spoken word recognition and embodied cognition.												54	58												2015	30	3					347	353		10.1080/23273798.2014.923105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2014.923105												2026-01-16	WOS:000369976200010

In this study, we employed whispered speech to examine an unresolved issue about congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical pitch processing, which also affects speech pitch processing such as lexical tone and intonation perception. The controversy concerns whether amusia is a pitch-processing disorder or can affect speech processing beyond pitch. Method: We examined lexical tone and intonation recognition in 19 Mandarin-speaking amusics and 19 matched controls in phonated and whispered speech, where fundamental frequency (f(o)) information is either present or absent. Results: The results revealed that the performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls in lexical tone identification in both phonated and whispered speech. These impairments were also detected in identifying intonation (statements/questions) in phonated and whispered modes. Across the experiments, regression models revealed that f(o) and non-f(o) (duration, intensity, and formant frequency) acoustic cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in phonated speech, whereas non-f(o) cues predicted tone and intonation recognition in whispered speech. There were significant differences between amusics and controls in the use of both f(o) and non-f(o) cues. Conclusion: The results provided the first evidence that the impairments of amusics in lexical tone and intonation identification prevail into whispered speech and support the hypothesis that the deficits of amusia extend beyond pitch processing.												3	4											APR	2022	65	4					1331	1348		10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00345												2026-01-16	WOS:000830953900007

Study Design: Prospective patient series. Setting: Tertiary hospital and research institute. Patients: Twenty five adult CI users, with ages ranging from 19 to 75 years old, participated in a year-long follow-up evaluation. There were also 40 normal hearing adult subjects who participated as a control group to provide the normal value range. Interventions: Musical sounds in cochlear implants (Mu. S. I. C.) test battery was undertaken to evaluate music perception ability. Mandarin Tone Identification in Noise Test (M-TINT) was used to assess lexical tone recognition. The tests for CI users were completed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the CI switch-on. Main Outcomes Measures: Quantitative and statistical analysis of their results from music and tone perception tests. Results: The performance of music perception and tone recognition both demonstrated an overall improvement in outcomes during the entire 1-year follow-up process. The increasing trends were obvious in the early period especially in the first 6 months after switch-on. There was a significant improvement in the melody discrimination (p<0.01), timbre identification (p <0.001), tone recognition in quiet (p<0.0001), and in noise (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Adult Mandarin-speaking CI users show an increasingly improved performance on music and tone perception during the 1-year follow-up. The improvement was the most prominent in the first 6 months of CI use. It is essential to strengthen the rehabilitation training within the first 6 months.												11	15											DEC	2017	38	10					E421	E428		10.1097/MAO.0000000000001580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0000000000001580												2026-01-16	WOS:000425284200006
J	Chen, Y				Chen, Yuan			Is Cantonese lexical tone information important for sentence recognition accuracy in quiet and in noise?	PLOS ONE				Article								In Chinese languages, tones are used to express the lexical meaning of words. It is therefore important to analyze the role of lexical tone in Chinese sentence recognition accuracy. There is a lack of research on the role of Cantonese lexical tones in sentence recognition accuracy. Therefore, this study examined the contribution of lexical tone information to Cantonese sentence recognition accuracy and its cognitive correlates in adults with normal hearing (NH). A text-to-speech synthesis engine was used to synthesize Cantonese daily-use sentences with each word carrying an original or a flat lexical tone, which were then presented to 97 participants in quiet, in speech-shaped noise (SSN), and in two-talker babble (TTB) noise conditions. Both target sentences and noises were presented at 65 dB binaurally via insert headphones. It was found that listeners with NH can almost perfectly recognize a daily-use Cantonese sentence with mismatched lexical tone information in quiet, while their sentence recognition decreases substantially in noise. The same finding was reported for Mandarin, which has a relatively simple tonal system, suggesting that the current results may be applicable to other tonal languages. In addition, working memory (WM) was significantly related to decline in sentence recognition score in the TTB but not in the SSN, when the lexical tones were mismatched. This finding can be explained using the Ease of Language Understanding model and suggests that those with higher WM are less likely to be affected by the degraded lexical information for perceiving daily-use sentences in the TTB.												3	3											OCT 25	2022	17	10							e0276254	10.1371/journal.pone.0276254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276254												2026-01-16	WOS:000956795200001

Effect of musical experience on learning lexical tone categories	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Previous studies suggest that musicians show an advantage in processing and encoding foreign-language lexical tones. The current experiments examined whether musical experience influences the perceptual learning of lexical tone categories. Experiment I examined whether musicians with no prior experience of tonal languages differed from nonmusicians in the perception of a lexical tone continuum. Experiment II examined whether short-term perceptual training on lexical tones altered the perception of the lexical tone continuum differentially in English-speaking musicians and nonmusicians. Results suggested that (a) musicians exhibited higher sensitivity overall to tonal changes, but perceived the lexical tone continuum in a manner similar to nonmusicians (continuously), in contrast to native Mandarin speakers (categorically); and (b) short-term perceptual training altered perception; however, there were no significant differences between the effects of training on musicians and nonmusicians.

The perception of both lexical tones and emotional prosody depends on prosodic features including pitch, intensity, duration, and voice quality. However, it is unclear which aspect of prosody is perceptually more salient and resistant to noise. This study aimed to investigate the relative perceptual salience of emotional prosody and lexical tone recognition in quiet and in the presence of multi-talker babble noise. Forty young adults randomly sampled from a pool of native Mandarin Chinese with normal hearing listened to monosyllables either with or without background babble noise and completed two identification tasks, one for emotion recognition and the other for lexical tone recognition. Accuracy and speed were recorded and analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Compared with emotional prosody, lexical tones were more perceptually salient in multi-talker babble noise. Native Mandarin Chinese participants identified lexical tones more accurately and quickly than vocal emotions at the same signal-to-noise ratio. Acoustic and cognitive dissimilarities between linguistic prosody and emotional prosody may have led to the phenomenon, which calls for further explorations into the underlying psychobiological and neurophysiological mechanisms.												8	8											OCT	2023	13	10							800	10.3390/bs13100800	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bs13100800												2026-01-16	WOS:001096019700001
J	Choi, W; Tong, XL; Cain, K				Choi, William; Tong, Xiuli; Cain, Kate			Lexical prosody beyond first-language boundary: Chinese lexical tone sensitivity predicts English reading comprehension	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This 1-year longitudinal study examined the role of Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity in predicting English reading comprehension and the pathways underlying their relation. Multiple measures of Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity, English lexical stress sensitivity, Cantonese segmental phonological awareness, general auditory sensitivity, English word reading, and English reading comprehension were administered to 133 Cantonese-English unbalanced bilingual second graders. Structural equation modeling analysis identified transfer of Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity to English reading comprehension. This transfer was realized through a direct pathway via English stress sensitivity and also-an indirect pathway via English word reading. These results suggest that prosodic sensitivity is an important factor influencing English reading comprehension and that it needs to be incorporated into theoretical accounts of reading comprehension across languages.

J	Lin, YS; Peng, SC				Lin, Yung-Song; Peng, Shu-Chen			Effects of frequency allocation on lexical tone identification by Mandarin-speaking children with a cochlear implant	ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA				Article								Conclusion. Frequency allocation with extended frequency ranges yielded significantly higher accuracy in pediatric CI recipients' lexical tone identification. These findings suggest that frequency allocation with extended frequency ranges may be useful in improving lexical tone recognition for at least some pediatric CI recipients. Objectives. To assess the effects of frequency allocation on lexical tone identification by Mandarin-speaking children with a cochlear implant (CI). Subjects and methods. In a prospective study, 15 prelingually deafened children between 7.17 and 16.17 years of age served as participants. Using Med-el CI devices, each participant's accuracy in lexical tone identification was compared in two conditions: first, the experimental condition, i.e. use of the extended frequency range from 233 to 8501 Hz; second, the control condition, i.e. use of the participant's clinically assigned frequency range from 300 to 8404 Hz. Results. The group mean of pediatric CI users' accuracy in lexical tone identification was 88.02% (SD = 6.31%) in the experimental condition and 83.82% (SD = 9.84%) in the control condition. The group mean was 4.20% (SD = 5.48%) higher in the experimental condition than that in the control condition; this difference was statistically significant (t(14) = 2.97, p=0.010).												3	4												2009	129	3					289	296	PII 907479420	10.1080/00016480701596047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016480701596047												2026-01-16	WOS:000263553200010
J	Shen, W; Hyönä, J; Wang, YX; Hou, ML; Zhao, J				Shen, Wei; Hyona, Jukka; Wang, Youxi; Hou, Meiling; Zhao, Jing			The role of tonal information during spoken-word recognition in Chinese: Evidence from a printed-word eye-tracking study	MEMORY & COGNITION				Article								Two experiments were conducted to investigate the extent to which the lexical tone can affect spoken-word recognition in Chinese using a printed-word paradigm. Participants were presented with a visual display of four words-namely, a target word (e.g., (sic),xiang4xian4, "quadrant"), a tone-consistent phonological competitor (e.g., (sic), xiang4ce4, "photo album"), or a tone-inconsistent phonological competitor (e.g., ,xiang1cai4, "coriander"), and two unrelated distractors. Simultaneously, they were asked to listen to a spoken target word presented in isolation (Experiment1) or embedded in neutral/predictive sentence contexts (Experiment2), and then click on the target word on the screen. Results showed significant phonological competitor effects (i.e., the fixation proportion on the phonological competitor was higher than that on the distractors) under both tone conditions. Specifically, a larger phonological competitor effect was observed in the tone-consistent condition than in the tone-inconsistent condition when the spoken word was presented in isolation and the neutral sentence contexts. This finding suggests a partial role of lexical tone in constraining spoken-word recognition. However, when embedded in a predictive sentence context, the phonological competitor effect was only observed in the tone-consistent condition and absent in the tone-inconsistent condition. This result indicates that the predictive sentence context can strengthen the role of lexical tone.												19	20											JAN	2021	49	1					181	192		10.3758/s13421-020-01070-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13421-020-01070-0		JUL 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000549229100001

Design: A lexical tone perception test and a pitch interval discrimination test were administered to a group of CI users and a group of normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Sample study: Nineteen adult CI users and 10 NH listeners who are native-Mandarin-Chinese speakers participated in the study. Result: Tone-perception performance of the CI group was, on average, 58.3% correct (+/- 19.78% correct), and performance of the NH group was near perfect. The CI group had a mean threshold of 5.66 semitones (+/- 5.57 semitones) in pitch discrimination as compared to the threshold of 0.44 semitone from the NH group. There was a strong correlation between the CI users' tone-perception performance and their pitch discrimination threshold (r = -0.75, p < 0.001). Conclution: Musical and lexical pitch perceptions are strongly correlated with each other and they might share similar mechanisms in electric hearing.												80	99											APR	2011	50	4					270	278		10.3109/14992027.2010.542490	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/14992027.2010.542490												2026-01-16	WOS:000288127000008

We tested 25 6- and 25 9-month-old German-learning infants, as well as 24 German adults and expected developmental differences for the two linguistic properties, as they are both carried by vowels, but have a different status in German. In adults, both lexical-tone and vowel-quality contrasts elicited mismatch negativities, with a stronger response to the vowel-quality contrast. Six-month-olds showed positive mismatch responses for lexical-tone and vowel-quality contrasts, with an emerging negative mismatch response for vowel-quality only. The negative mismatch responses became more pronounced for the vowel-quality contrast at 9 months, while the lexical-tone contrast elicited mainly positive mismatch responses. Our data reveal differential developmental changes in the processing of vowel properties that differ in their lexical relevance in the ambient language.												1	1											MAY	2025	52	3					592	614		10.1017/S030500092400014X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S030500092400014X		APR 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001209484200001
J	Zhou, N; Huang, J; Chen, XW; Xu, L				Zhou, Ning; Huang, Juan; Chen, Xiuwu; Xu, Li			Relationship Between Tone Perception and Production in Prelingually Deafened Children With Cochlear Implants	OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY				Article								Hypothesis: Performance in tone perception and production are correlated in prelingually deafened pediatric cochlear implant (CI) users across individuals. Demographic variables, such as age at implantation, contribute to the performance variability. Background: Poor representation of pitch information in CI devices hinders pitch perception and affects perception of lexical tones in cochlear implant users who speak tonal languages. Methods: One hundred ten Mandarin-speaking, prelingually deafened CI subjects and 125 typically developing, normal-hearing subjects were recruited from Beijing, China. Lexical tone perception was measured using a computerized tone contrast test. Tone production was judged by native Mandarin-speaking adult listeners as well as analyzed acoustically and with an artificial neural network. A general linear model analysis was performed to determine factors that accounted for performance variability. Results: CI subjects scored similar to 67% correct on the lexical tone perception task. The degree of differentiation of tones produced by the CI group was significantly lower than the control group as revealed by acoustic analysis. Tone production performance assessed by the neural network was highly correlated with that evaluated by human listeners. There was a moderate correlation between the overall tone perception and production performance across CI subjects. Duration of implant use and age at implantation jointly explained similar to 29% of the variance in the tone perception performance. Age at implantation was the only significant predictor for tone production performance in the CI subjects. Conclusion: Tone production performance in pediatric CI users is dependent on accurate perception. Early implantation predicts a better outcome in lexical tone perception and production.												75	88											APR	2013	34	3					499	506		10.1097/MAO.0b013e318287ca86	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0b013e318287ca86												2026-01-16	WOS:000316452300026
J	Ofuani, S				Ofuani, Sunday			CAN THE INTENDED MESSAGES OF MISMATCHED LEXICAL TONE IN IGBO MUSIC BE UNDERSTOOD? A TEST FOR LISTENERS' PERCEPTION OF THE MATCHED VERSUS MISMATCHED COMPOSITIONS	MUSIC PERCEPTION				Article								IN TONE LANGUAGES, ALTERATION OF LEXICAL TONE changes the intended meaning. This implies that composers should equally match lexical tone in their music for intelligible communication of the intended textual messages, a compositional approach termed Lexical Tone Determinants (LTD) in this study. Yet, in the Igbo language setting, some composers creatively disregard/mismatch lexical tone, which is branded as Musical/Creative Determinants (M/CD). It is believed that mismatched lexical tone in Igbo music alters listeners' comprehension of the intended messages; on the other hand, it is argued that thorough match of lexical tone constrains musical creativity. Listeners' perception of textual messages in LTD and M/CD music has not been empirically tested (side-by-side) to verify whether comprehension is lost or not, at least, in the Igbo language context. This empirical void gap is verified in this particular study to substantiate the propositions/findings using comparative measures to collect data through listeners' perception in live-performance of newly composed LTD and M/CD pieces. Specifically, it examines whether mismatched lexical tone in Igbo music alters message comprehension or not. The data were collated, presented, and analyzed statistically with chisquare deployed to evaluate their difference in message comprehension.												1	1											APR	2022	39	4					371	385		10.1525/MP.2022.39.4.371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/MP.2022.39.4.371												2026-01-16	WOS:000784451200003
J	Kung, C; Chwilla, DJ; Schriefers, H				Kung, Carmen; Chwilla, Dorothee J.; Schriefers, Herbert			The interaction of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context in on-line spoken word recognition: An ERP study on Cantonese Chinese	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								In two ERP experiments, we investigate the on-line interplay of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context during spoken word recognition in Cantonese Chinese. Experiment 1 shows that lexical tone and intonation interact immediately. Words with a low lexical tone at the end of questions (with a rising question intonation) lead to a processing conflict. This is reflected in a low accuracy in lexical identification and in a P600 effect compared to the same words at the end of a statement. Experiment 2 shows that a strongly biasing semantic context leads to much better lexical-identification performance for words with a low tone at the end of questions and to a disappearance of the P600 effect. These results support the claim that semantic context plays a major role in disentangling the tonal information from the intonational information, and thus, in resolving the on-line conflict between intonation and tone. However, the ERP data indicate that the introduction of a semantic context does not entirely eliminate on-line processing problems for words at the end of questions. This is revealed by the presence of an N400 effect for words with a low lexical tone and for words with a high-mid lexical tone at the end of questions. The ERP data thus show that, while semantic context helps in the eventual lexical identification, it makes the deviation of the contextually expected lexical tone from the actual acoustic signal more salient.

This may be because present CI speech coding schemes are largely based on English. This study aims to evaluate the relative contributions of temporal envelope (E) cues to Mandarin phoneme (including vowel, and consonant) and lexical tone recognition to provide information for speech coding schemes specific to Mandarin.Design: Eleven normal hearing subjects were studied using acoustic temporal E cues that were extracted from 30 continuous frequency bands between 80 and 7,562 Hz using the Hilbert transform and divided into five frequency regions. Percent-correct recognition scores were obtained with acoustic E cues presented in three, four, and five frequency regions and their relative weights calculated using the least-square approach.Results: For stimuli with three, four, and five frequency regions, percent-correct scores for vowel recognition using E cues were 50.43-84.82%, 76.27-95.24%, and 96.58%, respectively; for consonant recognition 35.49-63.77%, 67.75-78.87%, and 87.87%; for lexical tone recognition 60.80-97.15%, 73.16-96.87%, and 96.73%. For frequency region 1 to frequency region 5, the mean weights in vowel recognition were 0.17, 0.31, 0.22, 0.18, and 0.12, respectively; in consonant recognition 0.10, 0.16, 0.18, 0.23, and 0.33; in lexical tone recognition 0.38, 0.18, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.14.Conclusion: Regions that contributed most for vowel recognition was Region 2 (502-1,022 Hz) that contains first formant (F1) information; Region 5 (3,856-7,562 Hz) contributed most to consonant recognition; Region 1 (80-502 Hz) that contains fundamental frequency (F0) information contributed most to lexical tone recognition.												0	0											DEC 2	2021	15								744959	10.3389/fnins.2021.744959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.744959												2026-01-16	WOS:000730750900001

The subjects were implanted with the MED-EL Combi 40+ CI system. They were randomly assigned to each of the stimulation rate conditions according to an ABC design. In both the Cantonese lexical tone perception tests, the subjects reached the highest scores in the high-stimulation-rate condition, and the lowest scores in the low-stimulation-rate condition (P < 0.01). Post hoc comparisons between different stimulation rates did not yield consistent results. This study demonstrated that the maximum stimulation rate of 1800 pps/channel could be an 'optimal' stimulation rate and an informed choice of parameter for the benefit of Cantonese-speaking CI users in lexical tone perception.												14	17											DEC	2003	28	6					533	538		10.1046/j.1365-2273.2003.00747.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2273.2003.00747.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000186653000011

Method: Lexical-tone recognition was assessed in pediatric CI recipients and listeners with normal hearing (NH) in 2 tasks. In Task 1, participants identified naturally uttered words that were contrastive in lexical tones. For Task 2, a disyllabic word (yanjing) was manipulated orthogonally, varying in fundamental-frequency (F0) contours and duration patterns. Participants identified each token with the second syllable jing pronounced with Tone 1 (a high level tone) as eyes or with Tone 4 (a high falling tone) as eyeglasses. Results: CI participants' recognition accuracy was significantly lower than NH listeners' in Task 1. In Task 2, CI participants' reliance on F0 contours was significantly less than that of NH listeners; their reliance on duration patterns, however, was significantly higher than that of NH listeners. Both CI and NH listeners' performance in Task 1 was significantly correlated with their reliance on F0 contours in Task 2. Conclusion: For pediatric CI recipients, lexical-tone recognition using naturally uttered words is primarily related to their reliance on F0 contours, although duration patterns may be used as an additional cue.												45	49											MAY	2017	60	5					1223	1235		10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0048												2026-01-16	WOS:000402754000004

A series of language, auditory, and linguistic prosodic tests were given to 100 preschool children who had not yet learned how to read Chinese characters. The results suggested that lexical tone sensitivity and intonation production were significantly correlated with children's general vocabulary abilities. In particular, tone awareness was associated with comprehensive language development, whereas intonation production was associated with both comprehensive and expressive language development. Regression analyses revealed that tone sensitivity accounted for 36% of the unique variance in vocabulary development, whereas intonation production accounted for 6% of the variance in vocabulary development. Moreover, auditory frequency discrimination was significantly correlated with lexical tone sensitivity, syllable duration discrimination, and intonation production in Mandarin Chinese. Also it provided significant contributions to tone sensitivity and intonation production. Auditory frequency discrimination may indirectly affect early vocabulary development through Chinese speech prosody.												8	10											OCT	2016	123	2					365	382		10.1177/0031512516663164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0031512516663164												2026-01-16	WOS:000382950300001

Study 1 examined the contributions of lexical tone awareness to distinguish children with and without dyslexia with respect to their Chinese character reading skills. Two hundred and seventy Chinese children participated in Study 1. Ninety of these were children with dyslexia (equally recruited from second, fourth, and sixth grades). Moreover, ninety children functioned as a chronological-age control group, and an additional ninety children functioned as a reading-level control group. The participants were tested for nonverbal intelligence, Chinese character reading, and cognitive-linguistic skills and lexical tone awareness. Our results revealed a later developmental ceiling in Chinese children with dyslexia than in those without dyslexia. Furthermore, children's lexical tone awareness could serve to distinguish children with dyslexia from typically developing children in all primary school years. Study 2 compared the lexical tone awareness and Chinese character reading skills of Chinese children with dyslexia both before and after introducing the Perceptual Training Method. The participants in this study consisted of all the participants with dyslexia from Study 1, and the measurements were the Chinese character reading test and the lexical tone awareness task from Study 1. Our results revealed that only second-grade children with dyslexia gained substantially from the training on both lexical tone awareness and character naming, whereas those in the fourth grade obtained a significant improvement only on lexical tone awareness.

J	Wong, PS; Cheng, MW				Wong, Puisan; Cheng, Man Wai			On the Relationship Between General Auditory Sensitivity and Speech Perception: An Examination of Pitch and Lexical Tone Perception in 4-to 6-Year-Old Children	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Theoretical models and substantial research have proposed that general auditory sensitivity is a developmental foundation for speech perception and language acquisition. Nonetheless, controversies exist about the effectiveness of general auditory training in improving speech and language skills. This research investigated the relationships among general auditory sensitivity, phonemic speech perception, and word-level speech perception via the examination of pitch and lexical tone perception in children. Method: Forty-eight typically developing 4- to 6-yearold Cantonese-speaking children were tested on the discrimination of the pitch patterns of lexical tones in synthetic stimuli, discrimination of naturally produced lexical tones, and identification of lexical tone in familiar words. Results: The findings revealed that accurate lexical tone discrimination and identification did not necessarily entail the accurate discrimination of nonlinguistic stimuli that followed the pitch levels and pitch shapes of lexical tones. Although pitch discrimination and tone discrimination abilities were strongly correlated, accuracy in pitch discrimination was lower than that in tone discrimination, and nonspeech pitch discrimination ability did not precede linguistic tone discrimination in the developmental trajectory. Conclusions: Contradicting the theoretical models, the findings of this study suggest that general auditory sensitivity and speech perception may not be causally or hierarchically related. The finding that accuracy in pitch discrimination is lower than that in tone discrimination suggests that comparable nonlinguistic auditory perceptual ability may not be necessary for accurate speech perception and language learning. The results cast doubt on the use of nonlinguistic auditory perceptual training to improve children's speech, language, and literacy abilities.												3	3											FEB	2020	63	2					487	498		10.1044/2019_JSLHR-19-00104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2019_JSLHR-19-00104												2026-01-16	WOS:000561764300012

Internal and contextual cues to tone perception in Medumba	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This study presents results of an identification experiment with speakers of Medimba, a Grassfields Bantu language, aimed at evaluating the relative effects of f(0) and duration in cuing tonal contrasts, as well as the role of lexical vs non-speech pitch contexts in biasing tone perception. Results show that duration is a cue for tone perception, with the influence of duration strongest where target f(0) values were lower. Lexical tone perception is also sensitive to the identity of a preceding lexical tone, but not to the presence of a preceding non-speech pure tone.

Functionally integrated neural processing of linguistic and talker information: An event-related fMRI and ERP study	NEUROIMAGE				Article								Speech signals contain information of both linguistic content and a talker's voice. Conventionally, linguistic and talker processing are thought to be mediated by distinct neural systems in the left and right hemispheres respectively, but there is growing evidence that linguistic and talker processing interact in many ways. Previous studies suggest that talker-related vocal tract changes are processed integrally with phonetic changes in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus (STG/STS), because the vocal tract parameter influences the perception of phonetic information. It is yet unclear whether the bilateral STG is also activated by the integral processing of another parameter-pitch, which influences the perception of lexical tone information and is related to talker differences in tone languages. In this study, we conducted separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) experiments to examine the spatial and temporal loci of interactions of lexical tone and talker-related pitch processing in Cantonese. We found that the STG was activated bilaterally during the processing of talker changes when listeners attended to lexical tone changes in the stimuli and during the processing of lexical tone changes when listeners attended to talker changes, suggesting that lexical tone and talker processing are functionally integrated in the bilateral STG. It extends the previous study, providing evidence for a general neural mechanism of integral phonetic and talker processing in the bilateral STG. The ERP results showinteractions of lexical tone and talker processing 500-800 ms after auditory word onset (a simultaneous posterior P3b and a frontal negativity). Moreover, there is some asymmetry in the interaction, such that unattended talker changes affect linguistic processing more than vice versa, which may be related to the ambiguity that talker changes cause in speech perception and/or attention bias to talker changes. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural encoding of linguistic and talker information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Combination of absolute pitch and tone language experience enhances lexical tone perception	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				Article								Absolute pitch (AP), a unique ability to name or produce pitch without any reference, is known to be influenced by genetic and cultural factors. AP and tone language experience are both known to promote lexical tone perception. However, the effects of the combination of AP and tone language experience on lexical tone perception are currently not known. In the current study, using behavioral (Categorical Perception) and electrophysiological (Frequency Following Response) measures, we investigated the effect of the combination of AP and tone language experience on lexical tone perception. We found that the Cantonese speakers with AP outperformed the Cantonese speakers without AP on Categorical Perception and Frequency Following Responses of lexical tones, suggesting an additive effect due to the combination of AP and tone language experience. These findings suggest a role of basic sensory pre-attentive auditory processes towards pitch encoding in AP. Further, these findings imply a common mechanism underlying pitch encoding in AP and tone language perception.												9	11											JAN 15	2021	11	1							1485	10.1038/s41598-020-80260-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80260-x												2026-01-16	WOS:000609782400006

However, little is known about how senescence and cognitive decline influence lexical tone normalization in adverse listening conditions. This study aims to explore how F0 shifts of the preceding context affect lexical tone identification across different age groups in quiet and noisy conditions. Twenty-two Mandarin-speaking young adults, 22 middle-aged adults, and 21 older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participated in tone identification tasks with and without speech contexts. The identification tasks with contexts were conducted in quiet and babble noise with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) set at 5 and 0 dB. Results showed that contextual F0 cues exerted an equal impact on lexical tone normalization across all three age groups in the quiet environment. Nevertheless, under SNRs of 5 and 0 dB, noise nullified such an effect. Moreover, working memory was negatively correlated with the size of lexical tone normalization in the older group. These findings suggest that context effects on Mandarin tone normalization tend to be resistant to senescence and MCI but susceptible to babble noise, offering further insights into the cognitive processing mechanisms underlying speech normalization.												0	0											MAR	2025	157	3					1795	1806		10.1121/10.0036146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0036146												2026-01-16	WOS:001447584500001

This study examined the effects of lexical tone awareness (LTA) on early word recognition and the relationship between these abilities and word reading and spelling in subsequent grades. A longitudinal design was used to assess reading-related skills in 259 Thai children, first in kindergarten (130 girls, Mage=67.25months) and later in Grade 3 (Mage=102.25months). In kindergarten, the children were tested on lexical tone identification and differentiation, early literacy skills, non-verbal IQ, and early word recognition. In Grade 3, they were tested on word reading and spelling from dictation. The hierarchical regression analyses showed that the lexical tone identification skills in kindergarten accounted for 2% of the unique variance in early word recognition. However, none of the LTA skills could predict word reading and spelling from dictation after controlling for other literacy-related skills. These findings suggest that LTA skill positively associated with early word recognition at the kindergarten level, but not for word reading and spelling from dictation at a Grade 3 level.												7	7											AUG 31	2021	12								719552	10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719552	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719552												2026-01-16	WOS:000697985200001
J	Zou, Y; Lui, M; Tsang, YK				Zou, Yun; Lui, Ming; Tsang, Yiu-Kei			The roles of lexical tone and rime during Mandarin sentence comprehension: An event-related potential study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								This study used event-related potential (ERP) recording to examine the role of lexical tone and rime in Mandarin Chinese spoken sentence comprehension. A violation paradigm was adopted, such that selected target syllables in the sentences were replaced with tone-violated, rime-violated, or double-violated syllables. Participants judged whether each sentence was congruent. The behavioral results confirmed previous findings: Tone violation was more difficult to detect than rime violation. The ERP results showed that rime and double violations, but not tone violation, elicited a larger N400 than the original condition. Similarly, tone and rime violations elicited a larger P600 than the original condition, and the effect started and ended 50 ms earlier in the tone-violation type. Interestingly, the double-violation type differed significantly from the original type only in the posterior electrodes, suggesting a weaker P600 effect than the tone- and rime-violation types. The differences in ERP effects between rime and tone processing indicate that rime played a more important role in semantic access, while tone played a more important role in error recovery. A model of Chinese speech perception was proposed to accommodate the different roles of lexical tone and rime at different processing stages during sentence comprehension.												18	19											OCT	2020	147								107578	10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107578												2026-01-16	WOS:000581761400012
J	Wu, H; Zhang, YX				Wu, Han; Zhang, Yixiao			Late mismatch negativity of lexical tone at age 8 predicts Chinese children's reading ability at age 10	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								BackgroundDeficits in phonological processing are commonly reported in dyslexia but longitudinal evidence that poor speech perception compromises reading is scant. This 2-year longitudinal ERP study investigates changes in pre-attentive auditory processing that underlies categorical perception of mandarin lexical tones during the years children learn to read fluently. The main purpose of the present study was to explore the development of lexical tone categorical perception to see if it can predict children's reading ability. MethodsBoth behavioral and electrophysiological measures were taken in this study. Auditory event-related potentials were collected with a passive listening oddball paradigm. Using a stimulus continuum spanning from one lexical tone category exemplar to another, we identified a between-category and a within-category tone deviant that were acoustically equidistant from a standard stimulus. The standard stimulus occurred on 80% of trials, and one of two deviants (between-category or within-category) equiprobably on the remaining trials. 8-year-old Mandarin speakers participated in both an initial ERP oddball paradigm and returned for a 2-year follow-up. ResultsThe between-category MMN and within-category MMN significantly correlate with each other at age 8 (p = 0.001) but not at age 10. The between-category MMN at age 8 can predict children's ability at age 10 (p = 0.03) but the within-category cannot. ConclusionThe categorical perception of lexical tone is still developing from age 8 to age 10. The behavioral and electrophysiological results demonstrate that categorical perception of lexical tone at age 8 predicts children's reading ability at age 10.												0	0											OCT 21	2022	13								989186	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989186	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989186												2026-01-16	WOS:000879506100001

Past studies have exclusively focused on tone perception of the spoken language, and little is known as to the lexical tone processing in reading visual words and its associated brain mechanisms. In this study, we performed two experiments to identify neural substrates in Chinese tone reading. First, we used a tone judgment paradigm to investigate tone processing of visually presented Chinese characters. We found that, relative to baseline, tone perception of printed Chinese characters were mediated by strong brain activation in bilateral frontal regions, left inferior parietal lobule, left posterior middle/medial temporal gyrus, left inferior temporal region, bilateral visual systems, and cerebellum. Surprisingly, no activation was found in superior temporal regions, brain sites well known for speech tone processing. In activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to combine results of relevant published studies, we attempted to elucidate whether the left temporal cortex activities identified in Experiment one is consistent with those found in previous studies of auditory lexical tone perception. ALE results showed that only the left superior temporal gyrus and putamen were critical in auditory lexical tone processing. These findings suggest that activation in the superior temporal cortex associated with lexical tone perception is modality-dependent. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:304-312, 2015.

J	Shao, J; Zhang, CC				Shao, Jing; Zhang, Caicai			Dichotic Perception of Lexical Tones in Cantonese-Speaking Congenital Amusics	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Congenital amusia is an inborn neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing, which also induces impairment in lexical tone perception. However, it has not been examined before how the brain specialization of lexical tone perception is affected in amusics. The current study adopted the dichotic listening paradigm to examine this issue, testing 18 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 18 matched controls on pitch/lexical tone identification and discrimination in three conditions: non-speech tone, low syllable variation, and high syllable variation. For typical listeners, the discrimination accuracy was higher with shorter RT in the left ear regardless of the stimulus types, suggesting a left-ear advantage in discrimination. When the demand of phonological processing increased, as in the identification task, shorter RT was still obtained in the left ear, however, the identification accuracy revealed a bilateral pattern. Taken together, the results of the identification task revealed a reduced LEA or a shift from the right hemisphere to bilateral processing in identification. Amusics exhibited overall poorer performance in both identification and discrimination tasks, indicating that pitch/lexical tone processing in dichotic listening settings was impaired, but there was no evidence that amusics showed different ear preference from controls. These findings provided temporary evidence that although amusics demonstrate deficient neural mechanisms of pitch/lexical tone processing, their ear preference patterns might not be affected. These results broadened the understanding of the nature of pitch and lexical tone processing deficiencies in amusia.												5	5											JUL 7	2020	11								1411	10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01411	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01411												2026-01-16	WOS:000552381200001

With reference to English phoneme recognition, where performance usually does not improve after six or eight channels in cochlear implants (CIs), increasing total channel numbers continuously improved perception of Mandarin tones. Objective. To test our hypothesis that current CI strategies might be modified to improve Mandarin lexical tonal perception. Materials and methods. Lexical tonal perception tests using 48 monosyllables in Mandarin Chinese were conducted in 32 native Mandarin speakers with normal hearing. The performance of tonal perception was compared among the controlled factors, which were total channel number, number of channels allocated to the F0 spectrum, and whether there were spectral shifts in the electrode configuration. The experimental condition that preserves fine structure was used as a comparison. Results. The signal processing strategy using 16 channels - which is technically possible with current CI devices - produced better tonal perception than those using 12 or 8 channels. Increasing the number of fundamental channels did not improve tonal perception, and spectral shifts did not change tonal perception. An experimental condition (FiC12) that preserves the fine structure produced significantly better overall scores for tone perception than other experimental conditions with envelope strategies.												4	6												2007	127	5					505	514		10.1080/00016480600951434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016480600951434												2026-01-16	WOS:000246337700009

Target monosyllabic words were preceded by five types of primes: (1) the same real words (/lun4/-/lun4/), (2) real words with only tone contrasts (/lun2/-/lun4/), (3) unrelated real words (/pie3/-/lun4/), (4) pseudowords with only tone contrasts (*/lun3/-/lun4/), and (5) unrelated pseudowords (*/tai3/-/lun4/). We found a facilitation effect in target words with pseudoword primes that share the segmental syllable but contrast in tones (*/lun3/-/lun4/). Moreover, no evident form priming effect was observed in target words primed by real words with only tone contrasts (/lun2/-/lun4/). These results suggest that the recognition of a tone word is influenced by the representational level of tone accessed by the prime word. The distinctive priming patterns between real-word and pseudoword primes are best explained by the connectionist models of tone-word recognition, which assume a hierarchical representation of lexical tone.												1	1											MAY	2024	77	5					1125	1135		10.1177/17470218231203615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17470218231203615		OCT 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001087883000001

Method: Thirteen pure amusics (i.e., amusics with normal lexical processing), 5 tone agnosics (i.e., with lexical tone deficit), and 12 controls were screened with Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia and lexical tone tests (Nan et al., 2010; Peretz et al., 2003). Vowel-plus-tone identification tasks with the factors of vowel type and syllables with and without semantic content (e.g., real and nonsense words) were examined among the 3 groups, and identification scores were calculated in 3 formats: vowel-plus-tone identification, vowel identification, and tone identification. Results: Tone agnosics showed significantly poorer performances on identifications of vowel, tone, and vowel plus tone across monophthongs, diphthongs, and triphthongs in both real and nonsense words compared to pure amusics and controls. Their deficits were similar across the 3 types of vowels, while the deficit on vowel-plus-tone identification was more severe in nonsense words than in real words. On the other hand, pure amusics performed similarly with controls across all these conditions. Conclusions: Tone agnosia might affect both musical pitch and phonological processing, resulting in deficits in lexical tone and vowel perception. On the contrary, pure amusics's effect is primarily on musical pitch perception but not on lexical tone or phonemic deficit. Vowel type did not affect speech deficits for tone agnosics, while they relied more on semantic content as a compensation.												4	4											DEC	2019	62	12					4300	4308		10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-18-0440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-18-0440												2026-01-16	WOS:000561769300006

Design:Lexical tone recognition in quiet and noise (SNR= +5 dB) was measured with electric stimulation (CI alone) or bimodal stimulation (CI + hearing aid (HA)). The recognition and confusion rates of the four tones (T1, T2, T3 and T4) were analysed. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between hearing levels in the contralateral ear and bimodal benefits. Study sample:Twenty native Mandarin-speaking bimodal CI users, with ages ranging from 16-49 years. Results:Relative to the CI alone, mean tone recognition with the CI + HA improved significantly from 84.1-92.1% correct in quiet (+8 points) and from 57.9-73.1% correct in noise (+15.2 points). Tone confusions between T2 and T3 were the most prominent in all test conditions, and T4 tended to be labelled as T3 in noise. There was no significant correlation between the bimodal benefits for tone recognition and the unaided or HA-aided pure-tone thresholds at 0.25 kHz. Conclusion:Listeners with CI + HA exhibited significantly better tone recognition than with CI alone. The bimodal advantage for tone recognition was greater in noise than in quiet, perhaps due to a ceiling effect in quiet.												14	15											JUL 2	2020	59	7					548	555		10.1080/14992027.2020.1719437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2020.1719437												2026-01-16	WOS:000547153000009

Recent research in the acquisition of tone languages points to a distinct course of development as compared to nontone languages. Our purpose is to provide an integrated review of research on lexical tone acquisition. First, the linguistic properties and origins of tone languages are described. Following this, research on the acquisition of tones in perception and production is reviewed and integrated. Possible reasons for the uniqueness of tone in language acquisition are discussed.

Five-hundred-and-sixteen second-to-third grade Cantonese ESL children were tested on their Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity, English lexical stress sensitivity, general auditory sensitivity, and working memory. Structural equation modeling revealed that Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity contributed to English lexical stress sensitivity both directly, and indirectly through the mediation of general auditory sensitivity, in which the direct pathway had a larger relative contribution to English lexical stress sensitivity than the indirect pathway. These results suggest that the tone-stress association might be accounted for by joint phonological and acoustic processes that underlie lexical tone and lexical stress perception.												16	16											MAR 31	2017	8								492	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00492	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00492												2026-01-16	WOS:000397997200001

We examined this music-language relationship by investigating to what extent pitch deficits in these two domains were dissociable. We focused on a special neurodevelopmental pitch disorder congenital amusia, which primarily affects musical pitch processing. Recent research has also revealed lexical tone deficits in speech among amusics. Approximately one-third of Mandarin amusics exhibits behavioural difficulties in lexical tone perception, which is known as tone agnosia. Using mismatch negativities (MMNs), our current work probed lexical tone encoding at the pre-attentive level among the Mandarin amusics with (tone agnosics) and without (pure amusics) behavioural lexical tone deficits compared with age- and IQ-matched controls. Relative to the controls and the pure amusics, the tone agnosics exhibited reduced MMNs specifically in response to lexical tone changes. Their tone-consonant MMNs were intact and similar to those of the other two groups. Moreover, the tone MMN reduction over the left hemisphere was tightly linked to behavioural insensitivity to lexical tone changes. The current study thus provides the first psychophysiological evidence of subgroup differences in lexical tone processing among Mandarin amusics and links amusics' behavioural tone deficits to impaired pre-attentive tone processing. Despite the overall music pitch deficits, the subgroup differences in lexical tone processing in Mandarin-speaking amusics suggest dissociation of pitch deficits between music and speech.

Pitch cues are important for perception of music and tonal language; it is possible that music training may improve performance in both listening tasks. In this study, we investigated music training outcomes in terms of perception of music, lexical tones, and sentences in 22 young (4.8 to 9.3 years old), prelingually deaf Mandarin-speaking CI users. Music perception was measured using a melodic contour identification (MCI) task. Speech perception was measured for lexical tones and sentences presented in quiet. Subjects received 8 weeks of MCI training using pitch ranges not used for testing. Music and speech perception were measured at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after training was begun; follow-up measures were made 4 weeks after training was stopped. Mean baseline performance was 33.2%, 76.9%, and 45.8% correct for MCI, lexical tone recognition, and sentence recognition, respectively. After 8 weeks of MCI training, mean performance significantly improved by 22.9, 14.4, and 14.5 percentage points for MCI, lexical tone recognition, and sentence recognition, respectively (p < .05 in all cases). Four weeks after training was stopped, there was no significant change in posttraining music and speech performance. The results suggest that music training can significantly improve pediatric Mandarin-speaking CI users' music and speech perception.												32	38											FEB 27	2018	22								2331216518759214	10.1177/2331216518759214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2331216518759214												2026-01-16	WOS:000426577700001

J	Chen, F; Peng, G				Chen, Fei; Peng, Gang			Lower-level acoustics underlie higher-level phonological categories in lexical tone perception	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								The pitch-processing deficit associated with congenital amusia has been shown to be transferable to lexical tone processing. However, it remains unclear whether the tone perception difficulties of amusics are merely due to the domain-general deficit in acoustic processing or additionally caused by impaired higher-level phonological operations. Answers to this question can shed light on the influence of lower-level acoustic processing on higher-level phonological processing. Using a modified categorical perception paradigm, the present study indicates that the acoustic processing deficit systematically extends to higher-level phonological processing. These findings suggest that lower-level acoustics underlie higher-level phonological categories in lexical tone perception.

J	Chen, A; Liu, LQ; Kager, R				Chen, Ao; Liu, Liquan; Kager, Rene			Cross-domain correlation in pitch perception, the influence of native language	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								The current study explores how language experience may shape the correlation between lexical tone and musical pitch perception. A two domains (music and lexical tone) by two languages (tone, Mandarin Chinese and non-tone, Dutch) design is adopted. Participants were tested on their discrimination of Mandarin Chinese lexical tones, Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), and Musical Ear Test (MET). The Chinese listeners outperformed the Dutch listeners on both MBEA and MET, but had comparable accuracies for the lexical tone discrimination. Importantly, a significant cross-domain correlation was only observed for the Dutch listeners but not for the Chinese listeners. For tone language listeners, once lexical tones have been acquired, native listeners perceive them as phonological categories, and split them from other pitch variations that do not play a phonemic role. Non-tone language listeners, on the other hand, perceive both lexical tones and musical pitch on a psycho-acoustical basis, hence exhibit a unified perception of pitch across the two domains.												44	47												2016	31	6					751	760		10.1080/23273798.2016.1156715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2016.1156715												2026-01-16	WOS:000377776900004
J	Kalaivanan, K				Kalaivanan, Kastoori			Lexical tone perception and learning in older adults: A review and future directions	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Review								While the literature is well represented in accounting for how aging influences segmental properties of speech, less is known about its influences on suprasegmental properties such as lexical tones. In addition, foreign language learning is increasingly endorsed as being a potential intervention to boost cognitive reserve and overall well-being in older adults. Empirical studies on young learners learning lexical tones are aplenty in comparison with older learners. Challenges in this domain for older learners might be different due to aging and other learner-internal factors. This review consolidates behavioural and neuroscientific research related to lexical tone, speech perception, factors characterising learner groups, and other variables that would influence lexical tone perception and learning in older adults. Factors commonly identified to influence tone learning in younger adult populations, such as musical experience, language background, and motivation in learning a new language, are discussed in relation to older learner groups and recommendations to boost lexical tone learning in older age are provided based on existing studies.												0	0											OCT	2024	77	10					2023	2039		10.1177/17470218231211722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17470218231211722		NOV 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001114045600001

Lexical tone as a complex signal contains acoustic components that carry linguistic, paralinguistic, and nonlinguistic information. To examine these two hypotheses, the current study adopted triplet stimuli including Chinese characters, their corresponding pinyin with a diacritic, and the four diacritics representing Chinese lexical tones. The stimuli represent the variation of lexical tone for its linguistic and acoustic features. The results of a listening task by Mandarin Chinese speakers with and without aphasia support the functional hypothesis that pitch patterns are lateralized to different hemispheres of the brain depending on their functions, with lexical tone to the left hemisphere as a function of linguistic features.												3	3											MAR	2021	44	1					54	67		10.1515/CJAL-2021-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/CJAL-2021-0004												2026-01-16	WOS:000642449500004

Eighteen musicians and 21 nonmusicians participated in a typical categorical perception task. Results showed that musicians and nonmusicians had comparable degree of categorical perception of tones and stops. Compared to nonmusicians, musicians exhibited enhanced sensitivities to within-category lexical tone stimuli. However, this improved ability was not observed in the perception of stops. These findings imply that musical experience strengthens the acuity of subtle low-level acoustic variations between within-category lexical tone stimuli without interfering with the high-level phonological representations of lexical tones, and this facilitatory effect is selective and could not readily extend to stop consonants in native language.												3	3											JAN	2024	14	1							21582440241227703	10.1177/21582440241227703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241227703												2026-01-16	WOS:001157743100001
J	Zheng, XB; Ji, YL; Meng, XZ				Zheng, Xiaobei; Ji, Yinglin; Meng, Xiangzhi			Protracted Development on Native Tone Interpretation: Evidence From Mandarin-Learning Infants' Novel Word Learning	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Studies have shown that infants from cultures with tone languages develop categorical perception of their native lexical tone before their first birthday, but few studies have explored whether, and when, they interpret the phonemic function of lexical tone in word learning. Two habituation-switch experiments were conducted to explore whether Mandarin-learning infants could exploit tonal cues during their word learning, and detect a change when the association of two word-object pairs was switched. In Experiment 1, two words were solely differentiated by their lexical tones (fai/ vs. /fai/), and Mandarin-learning infants failed to detect the switch of tones at 14 months, but succeeded at 18 months. In Experiment 2, two words were markedly distinct (/fai/ vs. /bou/), and infants could detect the change of words as early as 14 months. The results indicate that infants may not refer to the lexical function of tone during their novel word learning until 18 months, even though infants from birth are able to distinguish the Tone 1 vs. Tone 3 contrast. Given that lexical tone is expressed by variations of the pitch contours, which are also related to intonation, infants' increasing knowledge of both tone and intonation may contribute to their misinterpretation of pitch contours in word learning at 14 months and, further, to their development of a sophisticated use of the phonemic function of lexical tone at 18 months of age.												0	0											JUL 5	2019	10								1512	10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01512	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01512												2026-01-16	WOS:000474204400001

Spectral and temporal cues for speech recognition: Implications for auditory prostheses	HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Features of stimulation important for speech recognition in people with normal hearing and in people using implanted auditory prostheses include spectral information represented by place of stimulation along the tonotopic axis and temporal information represented in low-frequency envelopes of the signal. The relative contributions of these features to speech recognition and their interactions have been studied using vocoder-like simulations of cochlear implant speech processors presented to listeners with normal hearing. In these studies, spectral/place information was manipulated by varying the number of channels and the temporal-envelope information was manipulated by varying the lowpass cutoffs of the envelope extractors. Consonant and vowel recognition in quiet reached plateau at 8 and 12 channels and lowpass cutoff frequencies of 16 Hz and 4 Hz, respectively. Phoneme (especially vowel) recognition in noise required larger numbers of channels. Lexical tone recognition required larger numbers of channels and higher lowpass cutoff frequencies. There was a tradeoff between spectral/place and temporal-envelope requirements. Most current auditory prostheses seem to deliver adequate temporal-envelope information, but the number of effective channels is suboptimal, particularly for speech recognition in noise. lexical tone recognition, and music perception.

J	Singh, L; Foong, J				Singh, Leher; Foong, Joanne			Influences of lexical tone and pitch on word recognition in bilingual infants	COGNITION				Article								Infants' abilities to discriminate native and non-native phonemes have been extensively investigated in monolingual learners, demonstrating a transition from language-general to language-specific sensitivities over the first year after birth. However, these studies have mostly been limited to the study of vowels and consonants in monolingual learners. There is relatively little research on other types of phonetic segments, such as lexical tone, even though tone languages are very well represented across languages of the world. The goal of the present study is to investigate how Mandarin Chinese-English bilingual learners contend with non-phonemic pitch variation in English spoken word recognition. This is contrasted with their treatment of phonemic changes in lexical tone in Mandarin spoken word recognition. The experimental design was cross-sectional and three age-groups were sampled (7.5 months, 9 months and 11 months). Results demonstrated limited generalization abilities at 7.5 months, where infants only recognized words in English when matched in pitch and words in Mandarin that were matched in tone. At 9 months, infants recognized words in Mandarin Chinese that matched in tone, but also falsely recognized words that contrasted in tone. At this age, infants also recognized English words whether they were matched or mismatched in pitch. By 11 months, infants correctly recognized pitch-matched and - mismatched words in English but only recognized tonal matches in Mandarin Chinese. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hong, SH; Wang, R; Zeng, B				Hong, Shanhu; Wang, Rui; Zeng, Biao			Incongruent visual cues affect the perception of Mandarin vowel but not tone	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Over the recent few decades, a large number of audiovisual speech studies have been focusing on the visual cues of consonants and vowels but neglecting those relating to lexical tones. In this study, we investigate whether incongruent audiovisual information interfered with the perception of lexical tones. We found that, for both Chinese and English speakers, incongruence between auditory and visemic mouth shape (i.e., visual form information) significantly interfered with reaction time and reduced the identification accuracy of vowels. However, incongruent lip movements (i.e., visual timing information) did not interfere with the perception of auditory lexical tone. We conclude that, in contrast to vowel perception, auditory tone perception seems relatively impervious to visual congruence cues, at least under these restricted laboratory conditions. The salience of visual form and timing information is discussed based on this finding.												3	3											JAN 4	2023	13								971979	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.971979	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.971979												2026-01-16	WOS:000913935900001
J	Mitterer, H; Chen, YY; Zhou, XL				Mitterer, Holger; Chen, Yiya; Zhou, Xiaolin			Phonological Abstraction in Processing Lexical-Tone Variation: Evidence From a Learning Paradigm	COGNITIVE SCIENCE				Article								There is a growing consensus that the mental lexicon contains both abstract and word-specific acoustic information. To investigate their relative importance for word recognition, we tested to what extent perceptual learning is word specific or generalizable to other words. In an exposure phase, participants were divided into two groups; each group was semantically biased to interpret an ambiguous Mandarin tone contour as either tone1 or tone2. In a subsequent test phase, the perception of ambiguous contours was dependent on the exposure phase: Participants who heard ambiguous contours as tone1 during exposure were more likely to perceive ambiguous contours as tone1 than participants who heard ambiguous contours as tone2 during exposure. This learning effect was only slightly larger for previously encountered than for not previously encountered words. The results speak for an architecture with prelexical analysis of phonological categories to achieve both lexical access and episodic storage of exemplars.												45	51											JAN	2011	35	1					184	197		10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01140.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01140.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000285968900007

Methods This cohort study enrolled 60 cochlear-implanted (cCI) Mandarin-speaking, school-aged children who underwent cochlear implantation before 5 years of age and 53 normal-hearing children (cNH) in Taiwan. The emotion recognition and the sensitivity of fundamental frequency (F0) changes for those school-aged cNH and cCI (6-17 years old) were examined in a tertiary referred center. Results The mean emotion recognition score of the cNH group was significantly better than the cCI. Female speakers' vocal emotions are more easily to be recognized than male speakers' emotion. There was a significant effect of age at test on voice recognition performance. The average score of cCI with full-spectrum speech was close to the average score of cNH with eight-channel narrowband vocoder speech. The average performance of voice emotion recognition across speakers for cCI could be predicted by their sensitivity to changes in F0. Conclusions Better pitch discrimination ability comes with better voice emotion recognition for Mandarin-speaking cCI. Besides the F0 cues, cCI are likely to adapt their voice emotion recognition by relying more on secondary cues such as intensity and duration. Although cross-culture differences exist for the acoustic features of voice emotion, Mandarin-speaking cCI and their English-speaking cCI peer expressed a positive effect for age at test on emotion recognition, suggesting the learning effect and brain plasticity. Therefore, further device/processor development to improve presentation of pitch information and more rehabilitative efforts are needed to improve the transmission and perception of voice emotion in Mandarin.

J	Yang, WQ; Xiao, R; Liang, DD				Yang Wanqing; Xiao Rong; Liang Dandan			Lexical tone perception mechanism in 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children in the pre-attention stage	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA				Article								Lexical tones are a key component of tonal language. The accurate perception of different Mandarin lexical tones is essential for Mandarin-speaking children to process spoken Chinese. Previous studies based on the speech perception model of nontonal language proposed perceptual narrowing theory, while later studies indicated that the perception of lexical tones might be more complicated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are an effective tool that can investigate Mandarin-speaking children's implicit perception of lexical tones. Some studies targeting children's speech perception have demonstrated that mismatch responses (MMRs, including MMN and p-MMR) indicate the development of phonetic representation. Moreover, these studies have provided empirical evidence in this field. However, ages between 2 and 4 years old needs to be explored empirically. The current study used MMN and p-MMR as the neural correlates of lexical tone perception of Mandarin in the pre-attention stage and investigated the development of lexical tone processing mechanisms in 2- to 4-year-old children. In addition, we paid attention to the influence of category information and the size of the deviance at the acoustic level. Sixteen 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children (7 boys and 9 girls; mean age: 3.4 years old; range: 2.6 - 3.10 years old) were recruited in this study. The study used the oddball paradigm and designed two experiments: Experiment 1 investigated the mismatch responses in across-category lexical tone perception in the participants. The stimuli consisted of three syllables: /yi1/ (T1), /yi2/ (T2), and /yi3/(T3). T3 was assigned as the standard; T1 was assigned as the large deviant; T2 was the small deviant. This experiment investigated how the deviance size affects children's perception of different lexical tones in the across-category condition. Experiment 2 investigated the mismatch responses of the participants to the perception of tones in the same category and were designated yi3a (T3a) and yi3b (T3b) within the category. These tones have the same phonological information but differ from the standard T3 stimulus in the acoustic information (based on the frequency and contour). The distances between T3a & T3 and T3b & T3 were modulated in Praat to control the distances of T1 & T3 and T2 & T3, respectively. This experiment detected the influence of the degree of similarity on the acoustic information on lexical tone perception without changing the category information. The results of the EEG data showed that (1) only the across-category large-deviance pair (T1/T3) elicited an obvious MMN response, indicating that 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children can distinguish tones with obvious category boundaries in the pre- attention stage; (2) the across-category small-deviance pair (T2/T3) and the two kinds of within-category deviations (T3a/T3; T3b/T3) achieved the same data performance: no significant MMN or p-MMR was elicited. However, the internal mechanisms of these two conditions are different. The former may indicate that 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children are in the period of transition from p-MMR to MMN. The latter may reflect that children have established a lexical tone category, and due to their immature perception ability, it is impossible for them to distinguish the differences among within-category lexical tones. In summary, the current study has filled the age gap in the relevant lexical tone perception neural mechanism research and has revealed what is crucial to children's lexical tone neural mechanism of perception development. Moreover, this research has identified the size difference between isometric across-category stimulation with within-category stimulation, which innovatively provides a reference for future research. The conclusion indicates that 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children are in the period of lexical tone category formation. In the pre-attention stage, the obvious category boundary of lexical tones can be distinguished accurately. For the inconspicuous category boundaries of lexical tones, the neural mechanism is transforming from p-MMR to MMN. The magnitude of the deviance does not affect lexical tone perception within the same category.												4	4											JUN	2020	52	6					730	741		10.3724/SP.J.1041.2020.00730	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1041.2020.00730												2026-01-16	WOS:000558749200006

The HiResolution (HiRes) sound-processing strategy is designed to better preserve temporal fine structure, or the detailed envelope information, of an acoustic signal. The newer HiRes 120 strategy builds on HiRes by increasing the amount of potential spectral information delivered to the implant user. The purpose of this study was to examine lexical tone recognition in native Mandarin Chinese-speaking children with cochlear implants using the HiRes and HiRes 120 sound-processing strategies. Tone recognition performance was tested with HiRes at baseline and then after up to 6 mo of HiRes 120 experience in the same subjects. Design: Twenty prelingually deafened, native Mandarin-speaking children. with ages ranging from 3.5 to 16.5 yr, participated. All children completed a computerized tone contrast test on three occasions: (1) using HiRes immediately before conversion to HiRes 120 (baseline), (2) 1 mo after conversion, and (3) 3 mo after conversion. Twelve of the 20 children also were tested 6 mo after conversion. In addition, the parents of 18 children completed a questionnaire at the 3-mo follow-up visit regarding the preference of sound-processing strategies and the children's experience related to various aspects of auditory perception and speech production using HiRes 120. Results: As a group, no statistically significant differences were seen between the tone recognition scores using HiRes and HiRes 120. Individual scores showed great variability. Tone recognition performance ranged from chance (50% correct) to nearly perfect. Using the conventional HiRes strategy, 6 of the 20 children achieved high-level tone recognition performance (i.e., >= 90% correct), whereas 7 performed at a level not significantly different from chance (50-60% correct). At the final test, either 3 or 6 mo after conversion, all children achieved tone recognition performance with HiRes 120 that was equal to or better than that with HiRes, although some children's tone recognition performance was worse initially at the 1 or 3 mo follow-up intervals than at baseline. Eight of the 20 children showed statistically significant improvement in tone recognition performance with HiRes 120 on at least one of the follow-up tests. Age at implantation was correlated with tone recognition performance at all four test intervals. Parents of most of the children indicated that the children preferred HiRes 120 more than HiRes. Conclusions: As a group, HiRes 120 did not provide significantly improved lexical tone recognition compared to HiRes, at least throughout the length of the study (up to 6 mo). There were large individual differences in lexical tone recognition among the prelingually deafened, native Mandarin-speaking children with cochlear implants using either HiRes or HiRes 120. Six of the 20 children performed at or near ceiling in the baseline HiRes condition. Of the remainder, approximately half showed significantly better tone recognition when subsequently tested with HiRes 120, although the extent to which this improvement may be attributable to factors other than the change in processing strategy (e.g., general development) is unknown. The children who benefited most from HiRes 120 tended to be those who were implanted at younger ages.												76	99											APR	2009	30	2					169	177		10.1097/AUD.0b013e31819342cf	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0b013e31819342cf												2026-01-16	WOS:000264046600003

M.; Woo, Pei Jun			The development of tone discrimination in infancy: Evidence from a cross-linguistic, multi-lab report	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE				Article								We report the findings of a multi-language and multi-lab investigation of young infants' ability to discriminate lexical tones as a function of their native language, age and language experience, as well as of tone properties. Given the high prevalence of lexical tones across human languages, understanding lexical tone acquisition is fundamental for comprehensive theories of language learning. While there are some similarities between the developmental course of lexical tone perception and that of vowels and consonants, findings for lexical tones tend to vary greatly across different laboratories. To reconcile these differences and to assess the developmental trajectory of native and non-native perception of tone contrasts, this study employed a single experimental paradigm with the same two pairs of Cantonese tone contrasts (perceptually similar vs. distinct) across 13 laboratories in Asia-Pacific, Europe and North-America testing 5-, 10- and 17-month-old monolingual (tone, pitch-accent, non-tone) and bilingual (tone/non-tone, non-tone/non-tone) infants. Across the age range and language backgrounds, infants who were not exposed to Cantonese showed robust discrimination of the two non-native lexical tone contrasts. Contrary to this overall finding, the statistical model assessing native discrimination by Cantonese-learning infants failed to yield significant effects. These findings indicate that lexical tone sensitivity is maintained from 5 to 17 months in infants acquiring tone and non-tone languages, challenging the generalisability of the existing theoretical accounts of perceptual narrowing in the first months of life.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSThis is a multi-language and multi-lab investigation of young infants' ability to discriminate lexical tones.This study included data from 13 laboratories testing 5-, 10-, and 17-month-old monolingual (tone, pitch-accent, non-tone) and bilingual (tone/non-tone, non-tone/non-tone) infants.Overall, infants discriminated a perceptually similar and a distinct non-native tone contrast, although there was no evidence of a native tone-language advantage in discrimination.These results demonstrate maintenance of tone discrimination throughout development.												11	12											MAY	2024	27	3								10.1111/desc.13459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/desc.13459		NOV 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001105921500001
J	Kadyamusuma, MR; De Bleser, R; Mayer, J				Kadyamusuma, McLoddy R.; De Bleser, Ria; Mayer, Joerg			Lexical tone disruption in Shona after brain damage	APHASIOLOGY				Article								Background: The issue of production and perception of lexical tone in patients with brain lesions has been investigated mainly through East Asian languages and Norwegian. The present study investigated the lateralisation of lexical tone in Shona, a Bantu language. Van Lancker (1980) proposed a continuum scale of the levels of functional pitch in the speech signal. According to the functional lateralisation account (FLH), the left hemisphere (LH) is associated with highly structured pitch contrasts, such as phonological tone, whereas the right hemisphere (RH) is specialised for the least structured pitch functions cueing emotional and personal information. The extant data show that the ability to produce and identify lexical tone is frequently more impaired as a result of lesions to the LH than RH lesions. Aims: The present investigation focused on the lateralisation of lexical tone in Shona speakers. The study sought to validate if the scale of hemispheric lateralisation as proposed by Van Lancker (1980) is also valid for Shona, a Bantu language. Methods & Procedures: We examined five LH damaged (LHD) patients and five RH (RHD) damaged patients using a confrontational picture-naming task and a lexical tone identification task of Shona lexical tone. The first experiment investigated the ability of LHD patients and RHD patients to identify Shona lexical tone in 60 disyllabic minimal pairs. The second experiment examined the ability of Shona brain-damaged patients to produce lexical tone using a confrontational picture-naming task with 120 lexical items. Outcomes & Results: We observed a dissociation in the performance of both the LHD and RHD patients in the two tasks. Both groups were impaired in the tone identification task relative to the non-brain-damaged controls. However, RHD patients performed significantly better than the LHD patients in the tone identification task. On the other hand, both LHD and RHD groups were equally impaired in the tone production task in comparison to the controls. Conclusions: The discrepancy in the production and perception of Shona lexical tone for this group of brain-damaged patients shows that, although the two modes are related, they do not always get disrupted at the same level after brain damage. The results from the tone identification task suggest to a certain extent that the FLH is also valid for Shona. In order to account for all the data there is need to carefully consider alternative accounts like the acoustic cue hypothesis (Van Lancker & Sidtis, 1992).												13	15												2011	25	10					1239	1260		10.1080/02687038.2011.590966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02687038.2011.590966												2026-01-16	WOS:000296195200006
J	Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY				Zou, Ting; Caspers, Johanneke; Chen, Yiya			Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.												3	3											JUN 6	2022	13								891756	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756												2026-01-16	WOS:000813299300001
J	Bradley, ED				Bradley, Evan D.			A Comparison of Stimulus Variability in Lexical Tone and Melody Perception	PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS				Article								Music and language share perceptual resources, and both map sound to invariant categories-invariant over and within speakers for language and over instruments and keys for music. The effects of stimulus variability on lexical tone and musical interval tasks among non-tone language speakers were compared using a matching (XAB) task under varying levels of stimulus variability. Listeners perceived Mandarin words better with single rather than multiple speakers and showed similar advantages in melodic interval perception for low (single instrument) versus high (multiple instruments) variability sets. Lexical tone and musical interval perception were affected similarly by increasing stimulus variability, on average. However, the magnitude of variability effects within subjects was not well correlated between the tasks, providing no evidence for shared category-mapping mechanism for the two domains. Instead, it suggests that crossover between tone and melody processing is driven by shared encoding of acoustic-phonetic features, and that differences in performance and learning by tone language speakers and musicians in the other domain represent progress along a phonetic-phonological-lexical continuum.												3	5											AUG	2018	121	4					600	614		10.1177/0033294117734832	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0033294117734832												2026-01-16	WOS:000438671900001
J	Chen, F; Zhang, KL; Guo, QQ; Lv, J				Chen, Fei; Zhang, Kaile; Guo, Qingqing; Lv, Jia			Development of Achieving Constancy in Lexical Tone Identification With Contextual Cues	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore when and how Mandarinspeaking children use contextual cues to normalize speech variability in perceiving lexical tones. Two different cognitive mechanisms underlying speech normalization (lower level acoustic normalization and higher level acoustic- phonemic normalization) were investigated through the lexical tone identification task in nonspeech contexts and speech contexts, respectively. Besides, another aim of this study was to reveal how domain-general cognitive abilities contribute to the development of the speech normalization process.Method: In this study, 94 five- to eight-year-old Mandarin-speaking children (50 boys, 44 girls) and 24 young adults (14 men, 10 women) were asked to identify ambiguous Mandarin high-level and mid-rising tones in either speech or nonspeech contexts. Furthermore, in this study, we tested participants' pitch sensitivity through a nonlinguistic pitch discrimination task and their working memory using the digit span task.Results: Higher level acoustic-phonemic normalization of lexical tones emerged at the age of 6 years and was relatively stable thereafter. However, lower level acoustic normalization was less stable across different ages. Neither pitch sensitivity nor working memory affected children's lexical tone normalization.Conclusions: Mandarin-speaking children above 6 years of age successfully achieved constancy in lexical tone normalization based on speech contextual cues. The perceptual normalization of lexical tones was not affected by pitch sensitivity and working memory capacity.												8	8											APR	2023	66	4					1148	1164		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00257												2026-01-16	WOS:000980362000005
J	Mattock, K; Molnar, M; Polka, L; Burnham, D				Mattock, Karen; Molnar, Monika; Polka, Linda; Burnham, Denis			The developmental course of lexical tone perception in the first year of life	COGNITION				Article								Perceptual reorganisation of infants' speech perception has been found from 6 months for consonants and earlier for vowels. Recently, similar reorganisation has been found for lexical tone between 6 and 9 months of age. Given that there is a close relationship between vowels and tones, this study investigates whether the perceptual reorganisation for tone begins earlier than 6 months. Non-tone language English and French infants were tested with the Thai low vs. rising lexical tone contrast, using the stimulus alternating preference procedure. Four- and 6-month-old infants discriminated the lexical tones, and there was no decline in discrimination performance across these ages. However, 9-month-olds failed to discriminate the lexical tones. This particular pattern of decline in normative tone discrimination over age indicates that perceptual reorganisation for tone does not parallel the developmentally prior decline observed in vowel perception. The findings converge with previous developmental cross-language findings on tone perception in English-language infants [Mattock, K., & Burnham, D. (2006).

Infancy, 10(3)], and extend them by showing similar perceptual reorganisation for non-tone language infants learning rhythmically different non-tone languages (English and French).

J	Cutler, A; Chen, HC				Cutler, A; Chen, HC			Lexical tone in Cantonese spoken-word processing	PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								In three experiments, the processing of lexical tone in Cantonese was examined. Cantonese listeners more often accepted a nonword as a word when the only difference between the nonword and the word was in tone, especially when the F0 onset difference between correct and erroneous tone was small. Same-different judgments by these listeners were also slower and less accurate when the only difference between two syllables was in tone, and this was true whether the F0 onset difference between the two tones was large or small. Listeners with no knowledge of Cantonese produced essentially the same same-different judgment pattern as that produced by the native listeners, suggesting that the results display the effects of simple perceptual processing rather than of Linguistic knowledge. It is argued that the processing of lexical tone distinctions may be slowed, relative to the processing of segmental distinctions, and that, in speeded-response tasks, tone is thus more likely to be misprocessed than is segmental structure.												161	187											FEB	1997	59	2					165	179		10.3758/BF03211886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03211886												2026-01-16	WOS:A1997WH92500001

J	Zhao, TC; Kuhl, PK				Zhao, T. Christina; Kuhl, Patricia K.			Higher-level linguistic categories dominate lower-level acoustics in lexical tone processing	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Native tonal-language speakers exhibit reduced sensitivity to lexical tone differences within, compared to across, categories (higher-level linguistic category influence). Yet, sensitivity is enhanced among musically trained, non-tonal-language-speaking individuals (lower-level acoustics processing influence). The current study investigated the relative contribution of higher- and lower-level influences when both are present. Seventeen Mandarin musicians completed music pitch and lexical tone discrimination tasks. Similar to English musicians [Zhao and Kuhl (2015). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 137(3), 1452-1463], Mandarin musicians' overall sensitivity to lexical tone differences was associated with music pitch score, suggesting lower-level contributions. However, the musician's sensitivities to lexical tone pairs along a continuum were similar to Mandarin non-musicians, reflecting dominant higher- level influences.

J	Sjerps, MJ; Zhang, CC; Peng, G				Sjerps, Matthias J.; Zhang, Caicai; Peng, Gang			Lexical Tone is Perceived Relative to Locally Surrounding Context, Vowel Quality to Preceding Context	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE				Article								Important speech cues such as lexical tone and vowel quality are perceptually contrasted to the distribution of those same cues in surrounding contexts. However, it is unclear whether preceding and following contexts have similar influences, and to what extent those influences are modulated by the auditory history of previous trials. To investigate this, Cantonese participants labeled sounds from (a) a tone continuum (mid-to high-level), presented with a context that had raised or lowered fundamental frequency (F0) values and (b) a vowel quality continuum (/u/ to /o/), where the context had raised or lowered first formant (F1) values. Contexts with high or low F0/F1 were presented in separate blocks or intermixed in 1 block. Contexts were presented following (Experiment 1) or preceding the target continuum (Experiment 2). Contrastive effects were found for both tone and vowel quality (e.g., decreased F0 values in contexts lead to more high tone target judgments and vice versa). Importantly, however, lexical tone was only influenced by F0 in immediately preceding and following contexts. Vowel quality was only influenced by the F1 in preceding contexts, but this extended to contexts from preceding trials. Contextual influences on tone and vowel quality are qualitatively different, which has important implications for understanding the mechanism of context effects in speech perception. Public Significance Statement Speech perception is highly context dependent. This study compares the strength of contextual influences in the perception of lexical tone and vowel quality in a number of ways. Perception of lexical tone was found to be influenced by locally preceding and following contexts, while vowel quality was only influenced by the preceding context, and that influence extended further back in time. These patterns demonstrate that the temporal scope of contextual influences are cue specific.												23	24											JUN	2018	44	6					914	924		10.1037/xhp0000504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xhp0000504												2026-01-16	WOS:000433153100009

Among Mandarin speakers, some amusics also have difficulties in processing lexical tones (tone agnosics). To examine to what extent these perceptual deficits may be related to pitch production impairments in music and Mandarin speech, eight amusics, eight tone agnosics, and 12 age- and IQ-matched normal native Mandarin speakers were asked to imitate music note sequences and Mandarin words of comparable lengths. The results indicated that both the amusics and tone agnosics underperformed the controls on musical pitch production. However, tone agnosics performed no worse than the amusics, suggesting that lexical tone perception deficits may not aggravate musical pitch production difficulties. Moreover, these three groups were all able to imitate lexical tones with perfect intelligibility. Taken together, the current study shows that perceptual musical pitch and lexical tone deficits might coexist with musical pitch production difficulties. But at the same time these perceptual pitch deficits might not affect lexical tone production or the intelligibility of the speech words that were produced. The perception-production relationship for pitch among individuals with perceptual pitch deficits may be, therefore, domain-dependent.												18	19											JAN 16	2014	4								1024	10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01024	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01024												2026-01-16	WOS:000331262500001

Lexical tone perception and production in Cantonese-speaking children with childhood apraxia of speech: a pilot study	CLINICAL LINGUISTICS & PHONETICS				Article								Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a paediatric motor speech disorder. We investigated the lexical tone perception and production abilities of children with CAS and the relationships between the two. Three children with CAS, aged between 3;7 and 5;8, were given the Cantonese Tone Identification Test (CANTIT) and the Hong Kong Cantonese Articulation Test (HKCAT) for assessment of tone perception and production, respectively. Accuracy and error patterns were investigated based on their performance on the two tests. Correlation analysis was performed on children's perception and production scores. Two children scored at the lowest rank on the CANTIT, while one child obtained a Z score of 0. All children scored three standard deviations below the mean on the HKCAT. No statistical differences were found among the six tones with respect to perception accuracy, H(5) = 3.731, p = 0.589. Error analysis showed that children with CAS demonstrated more confusion on perceiving tones compared with TD peers. There were no main effects for task (F(1,2) = 0.040, p = 0.859) or tone (F(5,10 = 0.997, p = 0.467); nor were there task or tone interaction effects on perception versus production accuracy (F(5,10) = 1.772, p = 0.206). Tone perception and production accuracy were not significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.181, p = 0.078). Tone perception deficits were evident in two out of three children with CAS, while all children had lexical tone production difficulties. In this small sample, tone production was more universally affected than tone perception.												11	11											JUN 3	2023	37	4-6			SI		316	329		10.1080/02699206.2022.2074310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2022.2074310		JUN 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000808483500001

Evidence for the central origin of lexical tone normalization (L)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Huang and Holt [(2009). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 125, 3983-3994] suggest that listeners may dynamically tune lexical tone perception via general auditory sensitivity to the mean f0 of the preceding context, effectively normalizing pitch differences across talkers. The present experiments further examine the effect using the missing-f0 phenomenon as a means of determining the level of auditory processing at which lexical tone normalization occurs. Speech contexts filtered to remove or mask low-frequency f0 energy elicited contrastive context effects. Central, rather than peripheral, auditory processes may be responsible for the context-dependence that has been considered to be lexical tone normalization. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Forty-three SNHL subjects and 46 ANSD subjects participated in a Mandarin lexical tone perception test using original and chimeric tone tokens. Ten sets of monosyllables, with four tone patterns for each, were processed through a 16-channel chimeric synthesizer in which a temporal envelope (E) from a monosyllabic word of one tone was paired with a fine structure (FS) from the same monosyllable of other tones. Results: Significantly negative correlations were present between tone perception scores and PTA0.5-4 kHz for both SNHL (P < 0.001) and ANSD (P < 0.001) subjects. Overall, 72.4%, 66.4%, and 46.3% of the tone responses were consistent with FS for the SNHL subjects with mild, moderate, and severe degree of hearing loss, respectively; and 28.4%, 23.1%, and 22.7% were consistent with FS for the ANSD subjects, with the equivalent degree of hearing loss. Similarly, 17.6%, 24.2%, and 37.7% of the tone responses were consistent with E for the SNHL subjects with mild, moderate, and severe degree of hearing loss, respectively; and 45.5%, 44.3%, and 36.5% were consistent with E for the ANSD subjects. Conclusion: Subjects with SNHL and ANSD may be separated by representing their FS- and E-consistent tone responses as a function of their pure-tone hearing thresholds.												6	9											JUN	2016	126	6					1420	1425		10.1002/lary.25595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lary.25595												2026-01-16	WOS:000379980200038

FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Review								A growing number of studies on the acquisition of lexical tone by adult learners have revealed that factors such as language background, musical experience, cognitive abilities, and neuroanatomy all play a role in determining tone learning success. On the basis of these findings, it has been argued that the effectiveness of tone learning in adulthood depends on individual differences in these factors. However, it is not clear whether similar individual differences play an analogous role in tone learning in childhood. Indeed, relatively few studies have made comparisons between how adults and children learn lexical tones. Here, we review recent developments for tone learning in both adults and children. The review covers tone training in a range of contexts, including in naive listeners, in native speakers of other tone languages, in listeners with varying levels of musical experience, and in individuals with speech and hearing disorders. Finally, we discuss the parallels between adult and child tone learning, and provide recommendations concerning how findings in adult tone training can provide insights into tone learning for children by accommodating the needs of individual learners.												13	25											JAN 23	2018	9								1	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00001												2026-01-16	WOS:000423080600001

There are few studies regarding lexical tone identification abilities in deafened children using either cochlear implants (CIs) or hearing aids (HAs). Furthermore, no study has compared the lexical tone identification abilities of deafened children with their hearing devices turned on and off. The present study aimed to investigate the lexical tone identification abilities of deafened children with CIs or HAs. Methods: Forty prelingually deafened children (20 with CIs and 20 with HAs) participated in the study. In the HA group, 20 children were binaurally aided. In the CI group, all of the children were unilaterally implanted. All of the subjects completed a computerized lexical tone pairs test with their hearing devices turned on and off. The correct answers of all items were recorded as the total score and the correct answers of the tone pairs were recorded as subtotal scores. Results: No significant differences in the tone pair identification scores were found between the Cl group and HA group either with the devices turned on or off (t = 1.62, p = 0.11; t = 1.863, p = 0.07, respectively). The scores in the aided condition were higher than in the unaided condition regardless of the device used (t = 22.09, p < 0.001, in the HA group; t = 20.20, p < 0.001, in the CI group). Significantly higher scores were found in the tone pairs that contained tone 4. Age at fitting of the devices was correlated with tone identification abilities in both the CI and HA groups. Other demographic factors were not correlated with tone identification ability. Conclusions: The hearing device, whether a hearing aid or cochlear implant, is beneficial for tone identification. The lexical tone identification abilities were similar regardless of whether the subjects wore a HA or CI. Lexical tone pairs with different durations and dissimilar tone contour patterns are more easily identified. Receiving devices at earlier age tends to produce better lexical tone identification abilities in prelingually deafened children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We addressed this issue by investigating whether and, if so, how Cantonese lexical tone awareness contributes to English expressive vocabulary knowledge in Hong Kong Cantonese-English bilingual children. Method: A sample of 112 Hong Kong Cantonese-English bilingual 2nd graders were tested on Cantonese lexical tone awareness, English lexical stress sensitivity, Cantonese-English segmental phonological awareness, and both Cantonese and English expressive vocabulary knowledge. Results: Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that Cantonese lexical tone awareness contributed indirectly to English expressive vocabulary knowledge through English lexical stress sensitivity and Cantonese-English segmental phonological awareness.

J	Yang, Q; Chen, YY				Yang, Qing; Chen, Yiya			Phonological competition in Mandarin spoken word recognition	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Most of the world's languages use both segment and lexical tone to distinguish word meanings. However, the few studies on spoken word recognition in tone languages show conflicting results concerning the relative contribution of (sub-)syllabic constituents, and the time course of how segmental and tonal information is utilised. In Experiments 1 & 2, participants listened to monosyllabic Mandarin words with the presence of a phonological competitor, which overlaps in either segmental syllable, onset and tone, rhyme and tone, or just tone. Eye movement results only confirmed the segmental syllable competition effect. Experiment 3 investigated the time course of segmental vs. tonal cue utilisation by manipulating their point of divergence (POD) and found that POD modulates the look trajectories of both segmental and tonal phonological competitors. While listeners can use both segmental and tonal information incrementally to constrain lexical activation, segmental syllable plays an advantageous role in Mandarin spoken word recognition.												13	15											AUG 9	2022	37	7					820	843		10.1080/23273798.2021.2024862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2021.2024862		FEB 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000761717800001

Following the procedure employed by Quam and Swingley (2010) and Singh et al. (2014), participants learned two novel word-object mappings. After training, word recognition was tested in correct pronunciation (CP) trials and mispronunciation (MP) trials featuring a pitch change. Since Limburgian is considered a restricted tone language, we expected that the pitch change would hinder word recognition in Limburgian, but not in non-tonal Dutch listeners. Contrary to our expectations, both Limburgian and Dutch children appeared to be sensitive to pitch changes in newly learned words, indicated by a significant decrease in target fixation in MP trials compared to CP trials. Limburgian and Dutch adults showed very strong naming effects in both trial types. The results are discussed against the background of the influence of the native prosodic system.												8	11											SEP 22	2017	8								1652	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01652	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01652												2026-01-16	WOS:000411427000003
J	Singh, L; Chee, M				Singh, Leher; Chee, Melissa			Rise and fall: Effects of tone and intonation on spoken word recognition in early childhood	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								A crucial component of word learning is the ability to recognize words in spite of the varying forms they assume. This may be particularly challenging in tone languages as learners have to develop tone representations in the face of intonational variation in order to accurately recognize words. The effects of intonational variation on word recognition of tone-marked words in Mandarin Chinese were investigated in toddlers and preschoolers using a cross-sectional design. Participants were presented with known words where intonation (question/statement) and tone (rising/falling) were independently manipulated. Results demonstrated that word recognition in toddlers was heavily influenced by changes in the pitch contour of a tone due to intonational variation. In contrast, preschool were able to recognize tone-marked words regardless of simultaneous intonational variation, demonstrating a comparatively robust representation of lexical tone. Results chart an evolution in integrating pitch cues to tone and intonation over the first few years of life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The language selected for investigation was Cantonese, a Chinese dialect spoken in southern China and Hong Kong with six lexical tones. Brain-damaged subjects were asked to identify and produce Cantonese words in isolation. It was found that lexical tone disruption is a generalized sign in aphasia. There was no evidence that there exists a particular pattern of tonal disruption in any specific type of aphasia. Results also indicated tonal disruption in both production and perception tasks. This impairment was often more severe with the perceptual ability than the production. Indeed, the data suggested that tonal disruption can be a disorder at either the phonological or phonetic level.												26	27											JAN-MAR	1995	9	1					79	92		10.3109/02699209508985326	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699209508985326												2026-01-16	WOS:A1995QH26300009
J	Xiao, R; Liang, DD; Li, SP				Xiao Rong; Liang Dandan; Li Shanpeng			Effects of aging on the Mandarin lexical tone perception: Evidence from ERPs	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA				Article								The accurate perception of lexical tones in Mandarin Chinese is an important foundation for successfully understanding spoken Chinese. Previous behavioral studies have shown that the ability to perceive lexical tones in Mandarin declines in elderly individuals. In addition to other research areas related to language and aging, the central issue in phonetic perception during aging concerns whether perceptual changes related to aging are area-specific or area-general. The area-general language hypothesis of aging assumes that changes in language perception related to aging are caused by a decline in both general sensory perception function and high-order cognitive function. In contrast, the area-specific language hypothesis of aging assumes that changes in aging-related language perception are caused by specific deficits in language processing. Previous studies mostly detected the state of attention and focused on how area-general factors affect the processing of segmental phonemes in elderly individuals. The present study examined neurophysiological responses, particularly that of MMN, to explore whether the aging of lexical tone perception is language-specific for Mandarin. The current study recruited 22 healthy elderly participants (age range: 55.6 similar to 79.6 years) and 18 young participants (age range: 22.7 similar to 29.0 years). In a passive oddball task, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine Mandarin lexical tone perception. Three syllables from a lexical tone continuum were chosen as stimuli to form an across-category stimulus pair and a within-category stimulus pair for the ERP oddball task. A non-speech stimulus pair was generated on the basis of the within-category stimulus pair. During the experiment, participants were instructed to ignore the presented sounds while watching a self-selected movie. ERP data showed that in the across-category condition, compared with the young group, the elderly group had a smaller MMN, and there was no between-group difference in the within-category condition. In the young group, a non-speech tone elicited a larger MMN amplitude than a speech tone that shared the same pitch contour, while the elderly group did not show a speech enhancement effect. In addition, compared with that of the young group, the amplitude of the MMN elicited by the non-speech contrast in the elderly group was significantly smaller. The results indicated that the general decline in central auditory processing function was not related to the pre-attention processing of lexical tone. In addition, when the level at which the auditory input stimulus could be sensed was controlled according to peripheral hearing abilities, the decline in peripheral auditory function was not related to the preservation of or decline in lexical tone perception in the current study. In the current study, there is no evidence that the age-related decline in area-general factors affects tone perception in the pre-attention condition. On this basis, this study further speculated that the ability of elderly Mandarin-speaking individuals to perceive lexical tone in pre-attention conditions was preserved and only declined for specific languages, and the above-mentioned decline in the processing of knowledge of Mandarin tone category and the wider preservation of the processing of speech tones are language-specific. The present study provides evidence for the area-specific language hypothesis of aging.												2	2											JAN	2020	52	1					1	11		10.3724/SP.J.1041.2020.00001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1041.2020.00001												2026-01-16	WOS:000551498700001
J	Wang, XD; Liu, AP; Wu, YY; Wang, P				Wang, Xiao-Dong; Liu, A-Ping; Wu, Yin-Yuan; Wang, Peng			Rapid Extraction of Lexical Tone Phonology in Chinese Characters: A Visual Mismatch Negativity Study	PLOS ONE				Article								Background: In alphabetic languages, emerging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies shows the rapid and automatic activation of phonological information in visual word recognition. In the mapping from orthography to phonology, unlike most alphabetic languages in which there is a natural correspondence between the visual and phonological forms, in logographic Chinese, the mapping between visual and phonological forms is rather arbitrary and depends on learning and experience. The issue of whether the phonological information is rapidly and automatically extracted in Chinese characters by the brain has not yet been thoroughly addressed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We continuously presented Chinese characters differing in orthography and meaning to adult native Mandarin Chinese speakers to construct a constant varying visual stream. In the stream, most stimuli were homophones of Chinese characters: The phonological features embedded in these visual characters were the same, including consonants, vowels and the lexical tone. Occasionally, the rule of phonology was randomly violated by characters whose phonological features differed in the lexical tone. Conclusions/Significance: We showed that the violation of the lexical tone phonology evoked an early, robust visual response, as revealed by whole-head electrical recordings of the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), indicating the rapid extraction of phonological information embedded in Chinese characters. Source analysis revealed that the vMMN was involved in neural activations of the visual cortex, suggesting that the visual sensory memory is sensitive to phonological information embedded in visual words at an early processing stage.												18	20											FEB 20	2013	8	2							e56778	10.1371/journal.pone.0056778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056778												2026-01-16	WOS:000315184200159

N.; Chen, Fei; Liu, Haihong; Liang, Wei			Effects of Fundamental Frequency Contours on Sentence Recognition in Mandarin-Speaking Children With Cochlear Implants	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Fundamental frequency (F0) is the primary acoustic cue for lexical tone perception in tonal languages but is processed in a limited way in cochlear implant (CI) systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of F0 contours in sentence recognition in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs and find out whether it is similar to/different from that in age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Method: Age-appropriate sentences, with F0 contours manipulated to be either natural or flattened, were randomly presented to preschool children with CIs and their age-matched peers with NH under three test conditions: in quiet, in white noise, and with competing sentences at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Results: The neutralization of F0 contours resulted in a significant reduction in sentence recognition. While this was seen only in noise conditions among NH children, it was observed throughout all test conditions among children with CIs. Moreover, the F0 contour-induced accuracy reduction ratios (i.e., the reduction in sentence recognition resulting from the neutralization of F0 contours compared to the normal F0 condition) were significantly greater in children with CIs than in NH children in all test conditions. Conclusions: F0 contours play a major role in sentence recognition in both quiet and noise among pediatric implantees, and the contribution of the F0 contour is even more salient than that in age-matched NH children. These results also suggest that there may be differences between children with CIs and NH children in how F0 contours are processed.												9	11											NOV	2020	63	11					3855	3864		10.1044/2020_JSLHR-20-00033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2020_JSLHR-20-00033												2026-01-16	WOS:000590167400022
J	Yu, YH; Shafer, VL; Sussman, ES				Yu, Yan H.; Shafer, Valerie L.; Sussman, Elyse S.			Neurophysiological and Behavioral Responses of Mandarin Lexical Tone Processing	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Language experience enhances discrimination of speech contrasts at a behavioral- perceptual level, as well as at a pre-attentive level, as indexed by event-related potential (ERP) mismatch negativity (MMN) responses. The enhanced sensitivity could be the result of changes in acoustic resolution and/or long-term memory representations of the relevant information in the auditory cortex. To examine these possibilities, we used a short (ca. 600 ms) vs. long (ca. 2,600 ms) interstimulus interval (ISI) in a passive, oddball discrimination task while obtaining ERPs. These ISI differences were used to test whether cross-linguistic differences in processing Mandarin lexical tone are a function of differences in acoustic resolution and/or differences in long-term memory representations. Bisyllabic nonword tokens that differed in lexical tone categories were presented using a passive listening multiple oddball paradigm. Behavioral discrimination and identification data were also collected. The ERP results revealed robust MMNs to both easy and difficult lexical tone differences for both groups at short ISIs. At long ISIs, there was either no change or an enhanced MMN amplitude for the Mandarin group, but reduced MMN amplitude for the English group. In addition, the Mandarin listeners showed a larger late negativity (LN) discriminative response than the English listeners for lexical tone contrasts in the long ISI condition. Mandarin speakers outperformed English speakers in the behavioral tasks, especially under the long ISI conditions with the more similar lexical tone pair. These results suggest that the acoustic correlates of lexical tone are fairly robust and easily discriminated at short ISIs, when the auditory sensory memory trace is strong. At longer ISIs beyond 2.5 s language-specific experience is necessary for robust discrimination.												30	34											MAR 6	2017	11								95	10.3389/fnins.2017.00095	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00095												2026-01-16	WOS:000395559600002
J	Lee, CY				Lee, Chao-Yang			Does horse activate mother? Processing lexical tone in form priming	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Lexical tone languages make up the majority of all known languages of the world, but the role of tone in lexical processing remains unclear. In the present study, four form priming experiments examined the role of Mandarin tones in constraining lexical activation and the time course of the activation. When a prime and a target were related directly in form (e.g., lou3 'hug'-lou2 'hall'), competitors that differed from the prime in tone failed to be activated, indicating the use of tonal information to distinguish between segmentally identical words. When a prime and a target were not form-related but were related through a third word that was not actually presented (e.g., lou3 'hug'-jian4zhu0 'building', where lou3 is form-related to lou2 'hall', which was semantically related to jian4zhu0), a mismatch in tone prevented activation of minimal tone pairs at 250 ms interstimulus interval (ISI) but did not prevent activation at 50 ms ISI. These results indicate that tonal information is used on-line to reduce the number of activated candidates, but does not prevent the minimal tone pairs from being activated in the early phase of lexical activation.												57	70												2007	50		1				101	123		10.1177/00238309070500010501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00238309070500010501												2026-01-16	WOS:000246228200005

Wearing a hearing aid (HA) in the contralateral ear for bimodal hearing may provide additional benefits. Objectives: To measure the bimodal benefits of music perception and tone recognition and to investigate the relationship between the two in Mandarin-speaking bimodal CI subjects. Materials and methods: Sixteen Mandarin-speaking bimodal CI subjects (aged between 16 and 49 years) participated in the study. Music perception (pitch discrimination, melody discrimination and instrument identification) and lexical tone recognition were tested with electric stimulation (CI alone) or bimodal stimulation (CI + HA). Results: Subjects showed a significant bimodal benefit in tone recognition in quiet and noise, and in all music perception tests. The bimodal benefit for tone recognition in noise was significantly correlated with that of pitch discrimination thresholds and instrument identification scores. Conclusion: Mandarin-speaking bimodal CI users achieved better music perception and tone recognition ability with CI + HA than with CI alone. The bimodal benefit of tone recognition was significantly correlated with that of music perception.												11	14											APR 1	2021	141	4					359	366		10.1080/00016489.2020.1782984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016489.2020.1782984		MAR 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000626103400001

Fine structure is important for lexical tone perception for normal-hearing (NH) listeners, and listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) have an impaired ability to use FS in lexical tone perception due to the reduced frequency resolution. The present study was aimed to assess which of the acoustic aspects (E or FS) played a more important role in lexical tone perception in subjects with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and to determine whether it was the deficit in temporal resolution or frequency resolution that might lead to more detrimental effects on FS processing in pitch perception. Fifty-eight native Mandarin Chinese-speaking subjects (27 with ANSD, 16 with SNHL, and 15 with NH) were assessed for (1) their ability to recognize lexical tones using acoustic E or FS cues with the "auditory chimera" technique, (2) temporal resolution as measured with temporal gap detection (TGD) threshold, and (3) frequency resolution as measured with the Q(10dB) values of the psychophysical tuning curves. Overall, 26.5%, 60.2%, and 92.1% of lexical tone responses were consistent with FS cues for tone perception for listeners with ANSD, SNHL, and NH, respectively. The mean TGD threshold was significantly higher for listeners with ANSD (11.9 ms) than for SNHL (4.0 ms; p < 0.001) and NH (3.9 ms; p < 0.001) listeners, with no significant difference between SNHL and NH listeners. In contrast, the mean Q10dB for listeners with SNHL (1.8 +/- 0.4) was significantly lower than that for ANSD (3.5 +/- 1.0; p < 0.001) and NH (3.4 +/- 0.9; p < 0.001) listeners, with no significant difference between ANSD and NH listeners. These results suggest that reduced temporal resolution, as opposed to reduced frequency selectivity, in ANSD subjects leads to greater degradation of FS processing for pitch perception.												10	19											JUN 8	2015	10	6							e0129710	10.1371/journal.pone.0129710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129710												2026-01-16	WOS:000355955300160

In identification tasks, Mandarin listeners identify tones in accordance with their native tonal categories whereas Dutch listeners do so based on acoustic properties. In discrimination tasks, Dutch listeners outperform Mandarin listeners especially in tonal steps on the continuum falling within the Mandarin tonal category boundary, whereas Mandarin listeners display high sensitivity in discrimination of stimuli falling across the native boundary. The CP index analysis shows a higher degree of CP in Mandarin (categorical perception) than in Dutch (psycho-acoustic perception) listeners.												11	12												2017	18	4					622	646		10.1075/lali.18.4.03liu	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/lali.18.4.03liu												2026-01-16	WOS:000425196300003

However, the source of such novelty remains unclear. Our goal in this study was to separate the effects of chimeric tonal novelty in Mandarin speech from the effects of auditory signal manipulations. We recruited 20 native speakers of Mandarin and constructed two sets of lexical-tone chimeras by interchanging the envelopes and fine structures of both a falling/yi(4)/and a rising/yi(2)/Mandarin tone through 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32, and 64 auditory filter banks. We conducted pitch-perception ability tasks via a two-alternative, forced-choice paradigm to produce behavioral (versus physiological) pitch perception data. We also obtained electroencephalographic measurements through the scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR). Analyses of variances and post hoc Greenhouse-Geisser procedures revealed that the differences observed in the participants' reaction times and FFR measurements were attributable primarily to chimeric novelty rather than signal manipulation effects. These findings can be useful in assessing neuroplasticity and developing speech-processing strategies.												1	1											DEC	2021	128	6					2527	2543	00315125211049723	10.1177/00315125211049723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00315125211049723		SEP 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000703171200001

Although the development of lexical tone perception ability has been examined in many behavioral studies, its developmental trajectory from childhood to adulthood at the neural level remains unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the issue by measuring the mismatch negativity (MMN) response to a Chinese lexical tonal contrast in three groups. Methods: The MMN response to a flat-falling tonal contrast (Tone1 versus Tone4) were recorded from children (25 participants aged 6-8), adolescents (26 participants aged 12-14), and young adults (20 participants aged 18-24). Nonsense speech stimuli were also used by superimposing Tone1 and Tone4 on an English syllable. Results: All three groups demonstrated typical early MMN responses in both the meaningful and nonsense syllable conditions. However, the MMN amplitudes varied significantly across groups, with the child group showing smaller responses compared to the adolescent and adult groups, while the latter two groups had similar MMN amplitudes. Conclusions: Neural sensitivity to tonal contrasts is not fully mature in children and reaches a more adult-like level during adolescence, with no significant difference in sensitivity to meaningful versus nonsense syllables. These results provide new insights into the neural development of lexical tone perception in a tonal language, highlighting its maturation during adolescence in this process.												0	0											JAN	2025	15	1							93	10.3390/brainsci15010093	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15010093												2026-01-16	WOS:001404570600001

Method: Auditory working memory and speech perception was measured in Mandarin-speaking CI and normal-hearing (NH) participants. Working memory capacity was measured using forward digit span and backward digit span; working memory efficiency was measured using articulation rate. Speech perception was assessed with: (a) word-in-sentence recognition in quiet, (b) word-in-sentence recognition in speech-shaped steady noise at +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio, (c) Chinese disyllable recognition in quiet, (d) Chinese lexical tone recognition in quiet. Self-reported school rank was also collected regarding performance in schoolwork. Results: There was large inter-subject variability in auditory working memory and speech performance for CI participants. Working memory and speech performance were significantly poorer for CI than for NH participants. All three working memory measures were strongly correlated with each other for both CI and NH participants. Partial correlation analyses were performed on the CI data while controlling for demographic variables. Working memory efficiency was significantly correlated only with sentence recognition in quiet when working memory capacity was partialled out. Working memory capacity was correlated with disyllable recognition and school rank when efficiency was partialled out. There was no correlation between working memory and lexical tone recognition in the present CI participants. Conclusions: Mandarin-speaking CI users experience significant deficits in auditory working memory and speech performance compared with NH listeners. The present data suggest that auditory working memory may contribute to CI users' difficulties in speech understanding. The present pattern of results with Mandarin-speaking CI users is consistent with previous auditory working memory studies with English-speaking CI users, suggesting that the lexical importance of voice pitch cues (albeit poorly coded by the CI) did not influence the relationship between working memory and speech perception.												33	39											JUN 12	2014	9	6							e99096	10.1371/journal.pone.0099096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099096												2026-01-16	WOS:000338701300027
J	Shuai, L; Gong, T				Shuai, Lan; Gong, Tao			Temporal relation between top-down and bottom-up processing in lexical tone perception	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Speech perception entails both top-down processing that relies primarily on language experience and bottom-up processing that depends mainly on instant auditory input. Previous models of speech perception often claim that bottom-up processing occurs in an early time window, whereas top-down processing takes place in a late time window after stimulus onset. In this paper, we evaluated the temporal relation of both types of processing in lexical tone perception. We conducted a series of event-related potential (ERR) experiments that recruited Mandarin participants and adopted three experimental paradigms, namely dichotic listening, lexical decision with phonological priming, and semantic violation. By systematically analyzing the lateralization patterns of the early and late ERR components that are observed in these experiments, we discovered that: auditory processing of pitch variations in tones, as a bottom-up effect, elicited greater right hemisphere activation; in contrast, linguistic processing of lexical tones, as a top-down effect, elicited greater left hemisphere activation. We also found that both types of processing co-occurred in both the early (around 200 ms) and late (around 300-500 ms) time windows, which supported a parallel model of lexical tone perception. Unlike the previous view that language processing is special and performed by dedicated neural circuitry, our study have elucidated that language processing can be decomposed into general cognitive functions (e.g., sensory and memory) and share neural resources with these functions.												48	57											MAR 25	2014	8								97	10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00097	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00097												2026-01-16	WOS:000333329900001

People with music training generally show more robust and faster tone perception. The present study investigated whether music training experience can facilitate tonal language speakers to accommodate speech variability in lexical tones. Native Cantonese musicians and non musicians were asked to identify Cantonese level tones from multiple speakers. Two groups were equally well in using context cues to normalize lexical tone variability at behavioral level. However, the advantage of music training was observed at cortical level. The time-domain ERP analysis suggested that musicians normalized lexical tone variability much earlier than nonmusicians (N1: 70-175 ms vs. P2: 175-280 ms). An exploratory source analysis further revealed that two groups probably relied on different cortical regions to normalize lexical tones. Left BA41 showed stronger involvement in musicians in accommodating tone variability, but right auditory cortex (including BA 41, 42 and 22) activated to a greater extend in nonmusicians.												7	7											DEC	2023	247								105348	10.1016/j.bandl.2023.105348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2023.105348		OCT 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001102251800001

However, a few psychoacoustic and perceptual studies have demonstrated that listeners with sensorineural hearing impairment may have an impaired ability to use fine structure information, whereas their ability to use temporal envelope information is close to normal. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relative contributions of temporal envelope and fine structure cues to lexical tone recognition in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Twenty-two normal-hearing subjects and 31 subjects with various degrees of sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. Sixteen sets of Mandarin monosyllables with four tone patterns for each were processed through a "chimeric synthesizer" in which temporal envelope from a monosyllabic word of one tone was paired with fine structure from the same monosyllable of other tones. The chimeric tokens were generated in the three channel conditions (4, 8, and 16 channels). Results showed that differences in tone responses among the three channel conditions were minor. On average, 90.9%, 70.9%, 57.5%, and 38.2% of tone responses were consistent with fine structure for normal-hearing, moderate, moderate to severe, and severely hearing-impaired groups respectively, whereas 6.8%, 21.1%, 31.4%, and 44.7% of tone responses were consistent with temporal envelope cues for the above-mentioned groups. Tone responses that were consistent neither with temporal envelope nor fine structure had averages of 2.3%, 8.0%, 11.1%, and 17.1% for the above-mentioned groups of subjects. Pure-tone average thresholds were negatively correlated with tone responses that were consistent with fine structure, but were positively correlated with tone responses that were based on the temporal envelope cues. Consistent with the idea that the spectral resolvability is responsible for fine structure coding, these results demonstrated that, as hearing loss becomes more severe, lexical tone recognition relies increasingly on temporal envelope rather than fine structure cues due to the widened auditory filters.												32	49											DEC	2011	12	6					783	794		10.1007/s10162-011-0285-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10162-011-0285-0												2026-01-16	WOS:000297135900011
J	Mok, PKP; Zuo, DH				Mok, P. K. Peggy; Zuo, Donghui			The separation between music and speech: Evidence from the perception of Cantonese tones	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This study investigates the relationship between music and speech, testing whether musical training has any facilitatory effects on native tone language speakers. Some Cantonese tone pairs are merging in recent years. The merging subjects have poorer general lexical tone perception than the control subjects. Previous studies showed that musical training facilitates lexical tone perception of nontone language speakers, but it is unclear if the same is true for tone language speakers. Three groups of listeners (standard Cantonese, merging Cantonese, nontone) with and without musical training participated in AX discrimination tasks of Cantonese monosyllables and pure tones resynthesized from Cantonese lexical tones. Results show that while musical training enhances lexical tone perception of nontone listeners, it has little influence on Cantonese listeners. The findings suggest that the linguistic use of tones is more fundamental and more robust than musical tones. Our results are compatible with the idea that linguistic and musical mechanisms belong to separate but overlapping domains. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

The tone recognition performance of cochlear implant listeners is below or close to the performance of severely hearing-impaired listeners. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the Mandarin lexical tone recognition performance of sensorineural hearing-impaired listeners and post-lingually deafened cochlear implant users. Methods: Tone recognition performance was measured for 30 normal-hearing subjects, 41sensorineural hearing-impaired listeners, and 12 cochlear implant users using 128 monosyllables recorded by a male and a female adult native Mandarin speaker. Results: The results indicated that the accuracy of tone recognition was 99.3%, 96.4%, 93.7%, 83.9%, and 81.0% for the normal-hearing, moderate, moderate to severe, severely hearing-impaired, and cochlear implant subjects, respectively. For the hearing-impaired subjects, a significantly negative correlation was observed between tone recognition performance and the audiometric hearing thresholds. For cochlear implant subjects, Tone 3 was the easiest one to perceive and Tone 2 was the hardest one to perceive. They tended to misperceive Tone 1 as Tone 2, and misperceive Tone 2 as Tones 1 and 3.												16	26											JAN	2013	133	1					47	54		10.3109/00016489.2012.705438	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00016489.2012.705438												2026-01-16	WOS:000312525800007

Frequency-specific temporal envelope and periodicity components for lexical tone identification in Cantonese	EAR AND HEARING				Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Asia Pacific Symposium on Cochlear Implants and Related Sciences	NOV, 2005	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA					Objectives: Temporal envelope and periodicity components (TEPC) in the speech signal have potentials to offer important cues for speech recognition especially in tonal languages. The aims of this study are: (i) to investigate the degree of contributions of TEPC to lexical tone identification in Cantonese; and (ii) to investigate whether or not the contributions vary among different frequency bands. The results of these investigations would reveal if there are any frequency-specific TEPC that are important for lexical tone identification. Design: TEPC of monosyllable words carrying different lexical tones, were extracted by the method of full-wave rectification and low-pass filtering. They were used to modulate a speech spectrum noise to create the test stimuli. Thus the stimuli contain only temporal envelope and periodicity components but no temporal fine structures of the original speech signal. Multiple sets of stimuli were created with different combinations of TEPC modulated frequency bands, Eighteen adult subjects with normal hearing participated in the study. Results: Lexical tone identification was the best when only the TEPC from the two high frequency bands (1-2 kHz and 2-4 kHz) of the original signal were provided, but the worst when only the TEPC from the two low frequency bands (60-500 Hz and 500-1000 Hz) were provided. The findings suggested that high frequency bands are carrying TEPC which are important for lexical-tone identification. Lexical tone identification performance was better for the male stimuli than the female ones. Conclusions: The results indicate the potential on improving speech recognition in tonal languages by manipulating TEPC via new signal processing algorithms in hearing prosthesis.												6	9											APR	2007	28	2		S			107S	113S		10.1097/AUD.0b013e31803153ac	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0b013e31803153ac												2026-01-16	WOS:000245285400026

Individuals with congenital amusia do not show context-dependent perception of tonal categories	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								Perceptual adaptation is an active cognitive process where listeners re-analyse speech categories based on new contexts/situations/talkers. It involves top-down influences from higher cortical levels on lower-level auditory processes. Individuals with congenital amusia have impaired pitch processing with reduced connectivity between frontal and temporal regions. This study examined whether deficits in amusia would lead to impaired perceptual adaptation in lexical tone perception. Thirteen Mandarin-speaking amusics and 13 controls identified the category of target tones on an 8-step continuum ranging from rising to high-level, either in isolation or in a high-/ low-pitched context. For tones with no context, amusics exhibited reduced categorical perception than controls. While controls? lexical tone categorization demonstrated a significant context effect due to perceptual adaptation, amusics showed similar categorization patterns across both contexts. These findings suggest that congenital amusia impacts the extraction of context-dependent tonal categories in speech perception, indicating that perceptual adaptation may depend on listeners? perceptual acuity.												9	9											APR	2021	215								104908	10.1016/j.bl.2021.104908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bl.2021.104908												2026-01-16	WOS:000636792100002
J	Huang, JY; Holt, LL				Huang, Jingyuan; Holt, Lori L.			General perceptual contributions to lexical tone normalization	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Within tone languages that use pitch variations to contrast meaning, large variability exists in the pitches produced by different speakers. Context-dependent perception may help to resolve this perceptual challenge. However, whether speakers rely on context in contour tone perception is unclear; previous studies have produced inconsistent results. The present study aimed to provide an unambiguous test of the effect of context on contour lexical tone perception and to explore its underlying mechanisms. In three experiments, Mandarin listeners' perception of Mandarin first and second (high-level and mid-rising) tones was investigated with preceding speech and non-speech contexts. Results indicate that the mean fundamental frequency (f0) of a preceding sentence affects perception of contour lexical tones and the effect is contrastive. Following a sentence with a higher-frequency mean f0, the following syllable is more likely to be perceived as a lower frequency lexical tone and vice versa. Moreover, non-speech precursors modeling the mean spectrum of f0 also elicit this effect, suggesting general perceptual processing rather than articulatory-based or speaker-identity-driven mechanisms.

However, previous findings have been mixed with regard to the hemispheric specialization for the perception of linguistic pitch patterns in native speakers of tonal language. In this study, we performed two activation likelihood estimation (ALE) metaanalyses, one on neuroimaging studies of auditory processing of lexical tones in tonal languages (17 studies), and the other on auditory processing of lexical information in non-tonal languages as a control analysis for comparison (15 studies). The lexical tone ALE analysis showed significant brain activations in bilateral inferior prefrontal regions, bilateral superior temporal regions and the right caudate, while the control ALE analysis showed significant cortical activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left temporoparietal regions. However, we failed to obtain significant differences from the contrast analysis between two auditory conditions, which might be caused by the limited number of studies available for comparison. Although the current study lacks evidence to argue for a lexical tone specific activation pattern, our results provide clues and directions for future investigations on this topic, more sophisticated methods are needed to explore this question in more depth as well.												25	26											JUL 26	2017	11								375	10.3389/fnhum.2017.00375	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00375												2026-01-16	WOS:000406384600001

In the present study, the just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of tone pitch contour change were examined for three groups of Mandarin-native listeners: amusics with (tone agnosics) and without lexical tone difficulties (pure amusics), and matched controls. Tone agnosics showed significantly larger JNDs than normal controls, while pure amusics performed comparably with the controls. These results suggest that only those amusics with behavioral lexical tone deficits might be psychophysically impaired in pitch contour discrimination.

The current study aimed to investigate the bimodal benefit for lexical tone recognition in Mandarin-speaking preschoolers using a CI and an HA in opposite ears. The child participants were required to complete tone identification in quiet and in noise with CI + HA in comparison with CI alone. While the bimodal listeners showed confusion between Tone 2 and Tone 3 in recognition, the additional acoustic information from the contralateral HA alleviated confusion between these two tones in quiet. Moreover, significant improvement was demonstrated in the CI + HA condition over the CI alone condition in noise. The bimodal benefit for individual subjects could be predicted by the low-frequency hearing threshold of the non-implanted ear and the duration of bimodal use. The findings support the clinical practice to fit a contralateral HA in the non-implanted ear for the potential benefit in Mandarin tone recognition in CI children. The limitations call for further studies on auditory plasticity on an individual basis to gain insights on the contributing factors to the bimodal benefit or its absence.												16	17											APR	2020	10	4							238	10.3390/brainsci10040238	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10040238												2026-01-16	WOS:000534271500028

The fundamental frequency (F0) of Thai tones was either degraded using an 8-band vocoder that reduced fine spectral details and frequency-modulation cues, or extracted and used to modulate the F0 of click trains. Mandarin listeners scored lower than French listeners in the discrimination of vocoded lexical tones. For click trains, Mandarin listeners outperformed French listeners. These preliminary results suggest that the perceptual weight of the fine spectro-temporal modulation cues conveying F0 information is enhanced for adults speaking a tonal language.

Native Language Perceptual Sensitivity Predicts Nonnative Speech Perception Differently in Younger and Older Singaporean Bilinguals	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: We investigate in this study how individual variability in native language speech perception (termed Perceptual Sensitivity) influences nonnative speech perception in Singaporean Tamil-English bilinguals. Further, we assess if and how contextual and demographic factors influence Perceptual Sensitivity in the acquired languages and if the influence of Perceptual Sensitivity on nonnative speech perception is different across younger and older bilinguals. Method: Perceptual Sensitivity in the native languages was examined by implementing Tamil and English gating tasks in 87 Singaporean Tamil-English bilinguals from two age groups (younger: 19-33 years; older: 55-70 years). Mandarin lexical tone discrimination was implemented as a measure of nonnative speech perception. Results: There was a wide range of variability in Perceptual Sensitivity scores in both languages across both age groups. Perceptual Sensitivity in the first native language (L1 Tamil) was a robust predictor of nonnative speech perception across both age groups, especially for the older bilinguals. However, general intelligence emerged as a stronger predictor than Tamil Perceptual Sensitivity in younger bilinguals. The influence of Tamil Perceptual Sensitivity on lexical tone perception was not tone-specific, supporting a general enhancement of lexical tone perception with better Tamil Perceptual Sensitivity. There was an influence of demographic factors on English Perceptual Sensitivity in older bilinguals, but not for Tamil and not in younger bilinguals. Conclusions: Our findings corroborate with previous studies in showing that native language Perceptual Sensitivity is positively associated with and predicts nonnative speech perception in younger and older adulthood regardless of language similarity but to varying degrees. Specifically, the influence of Perceptual Sensitivity on nonnative speech perception is stronger in older adulthood, suggesting a possible shift in reliance on crystallized language knowledge with age. Proficiency and use, among other demographic and language variables, do not appear to influence L1 Perceptual Sensitivity in a lesser used language (Tamil) as significantly as previously assumed.												3	3											MAR	2023	66	3					987	1017		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00199												2026-01-16	WOS:001259422200012

Objectives: To explore the characteristic of lexical tone perception in native Mandarin speakers with SNHL. Materials and methods: Three types of continuum (Tone1/Tone2, Tone1/Tone4 and Tone2/Tone3) were constructed and each of them includes 15 stimuli which were resynthesized by applying the pitch-synchronous overlap and add (PSOLA) method implemented in Praat to the same Mandarin syllable, /a/, with a high-level tone produced by a female speaker. Forty native Mandarin NH speakers and 23 native Mandarin speakers with mild to moderate SNHL were recruited. A two alternative-forced-choice identification task was used to acquire the tonal perceptual data. Results: All tone perception curves owns the characteristic of CP in SNHL subjects. All tone perception curves were S-shape in SNHL subjects same as those in NH subjects. No significant difference of each continuum was observed between SNHL and NH. Conclusions: CP of lexical tone perception could be observed in native Mandarin speakers with mild to moderate SNHL. The slight damage in the peripheral auditory system did not change characteristic of lexical tone perception.												1	2												2018	138	9					801	806		10.1080/00016489.2018.1467040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016489.2018.1467040												2026-01-16	WOS:000443836800007

Pitch perception and production in congenital amusia: Evidence from Cantonese speakers	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This study investigated pitch perception and production in speech and music in individuals with congenital amusia (a disorder of musical pitch processing) who are native speakers of Cantonese, a tone language with a highly complex tonal system. Sixteen Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics and 16 controls performed a set of lexical tone perception, production, singing, and psychophysical pitch threshold tasks. Their tone production accuracy and singing proficiency were subsequently judged by independent listeners, and subjected to acoustic analyses. Relative to controls, amusics showed impaired discrimination of lexical tones in both speech and non-speech conditions. They also received lower ratings for singing proficiency, producing larger pitch interval deviations and making more pitch interval errors compared to controls. Demonstrating higher pitch direction identification thresholds than controls for both speech syllables and piano tones, amusics nevertheless produced native lexical tones with comparable pitch trajectories and intelligibility as controls. Significant correlations were found between pitch threshold and lexical tone perception, music perception and production, but not between lexical tone perception and production for amusics. These findings provide further evidence that congenital amusia is a domain-general language-independent pitch-processing deficit that is associated with severely impaired music perception and production, mildly impaired speech perception, and largely intact speech production.

The results indicated that different types of phonemic contrasts, and even the identification and discrimination of the same phonemic contrast, matured asynchronously. The observation that tone and vowel perception are achieved earlier than consonant perception supports the phonological saliency hypothesis.												13	17											JAN	2023	94	1					28	43		10.1111/cdev.13837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13837		AUG 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000835319100001

Bimodal hearing utilizes residual acoustic hearing in the contralateral side and may offer benefits for tone recognition in noise. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate tone recognition in both steady-state noise and multi-talker babbles by the prelingually-deafened, Mandarin-speaking children with unilateral CIs or bimodal hearing. Methods: Fifty-three prelingually-deafened, Mandarin-speaking children who received CIs participated in this study. Twenty-two of them were unilateral CI users and 31 wore a hearing aid (HA) in the contralateral ear (i.e., bimodal hearing). All subjects were tested for Mandarin tone recognition in quiet and in two types of maskers: speech-spectrum-shaped noise (SSN) and two-talker babbles (TTB) at four signal-to-noise ratios (-6, 0, +6, and +12 dB). Results: While no differences existed in tone recognition in quiet between the two groups, the Bimodal group outperformed the Unilateral CI group under noise conditions. The differences between the two groups were significant at SNRs of 0, +6, and +12 dB in the SSN conditions (all p < 0.05), and at SNRs of +6 and +12 dB of TTB conditions (both p < 0.01), but not significant at other conditions (p > 0.05). The TTB exerted a greater masking effect than the SSN for tone recognition in the Unilateral CI group as well as in the Bimodal group at all SNRs tested (all p < 0.05). Among demographic or audiometric variables, only age at implantation showed a weak but significant correlation with the mean tone recognition performance under the SSN conditions (r = -0.276, p = 0.045). However, when Bonferroni correction was applied to the correlation analysis results, the weak correlation became not significant. Conclusion: Prelingually-deafened children with CIs face challenges in tone perception in noisy environments, especially when the noise is fluctuating in amplitude such as the multi-talker babbles. Wearing a HA on the contralateral side when residual hearing permits is beneficial for tone recognition in noise.												2	2											JUL	2024	182								112020	10.1016/j.ijporl.2024.112020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2024.112020		JUL 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001265493000001

Observing gesture at learning enhances subsequent phonological and semantic processing of L2 words: An N400 study	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								This study employed the N400 event-related potential (ERP) to investigate how observing different types of gestures at learning affects the subsequent processing of L2 Mandarin words differing in lexical tone by L1 English speakers. The effects of pitch gestures conveying lexical tones (e.g., upwards diagonal movements for rising tone), semantic gestures conveying word meanings (e.g., waving goodbye for to wave), and no gesture were compared. In a lexical tone discrimination task, larger N400s for Mandarin target words mismatching vs. matching Mandarin prime words in lexical tone were observed for words learned with pitch gesture. In a meaning discrimination task, larger N400s for English target words mismatching vs. matching Mandarin prime words in meaning were observed for words learned with pitch and semantic gesture. These findings provide the first neural evidence that observing gestures during L2 word learning enhances subsequent phonological and semantic processing of learned L2 words.												9	10											NOV	2023	246								105327	10.1016/j.bandl.2023.105327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2023.105327		OCT 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001088480200001

However, correlational studies have seldom considered the role of musical instruments in music-to-language transfer. Addressing this research gap could contribute to a nuanced understanding of music-to-language transfer. To this end, we investigated whether pitched musicians had a unique musical advantage in lexical tone perception relative to unpitched musicians and nonmusicians. Specifically, we compared Cantonese pitched musicians, unpitched musicians, and nonmusicians on Thai tone discrimination and sequence recall. In the Thai tone discrimination task, the pitched musicians outperformed the unpitched musicians and the nonmusicians. Moreover, the unpitched musicians and the nonmusicians performed similarly. In the Thai tone sequence recall task, both pitched and unpitched musicians recalled level tone sequences more accurately than the nonmusicians, but the pitched musicians showed the largest musical advantage. However, the three groups recalled contour tone sequences with similar accuracy. Collectively, the pitched musicians had a unique musical advantage in lexical tone discrimination and the largest musical advantage in level tone sequence recall. From a theoretical perspective, this study offers correlational evidence for the Precision element of the OPERA hypothesis. The choice of musical instrumental may matter for musicto-language transfer in lexical tone discrimination and level tone sequence recall.												8	8											JUN	2024	41	5					360	377		10.1525/MP.2024.41.5.360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/MP.2024.41.5.360												2026-01-16	WOS:001234473500004
J	Zhang, J; Meng, YX; Wu, CG; Yuan, Z				Zhang, Juan; Meng, Yaxuan; Wu, Chenggang; Yuan, Zhen			Spoken Word Recognition across Language Boundary: ERP Evidence of Prosodic Transfer Driven by Pitch	BRAIN SCIENCES				Article								Extensive research has explored the perception of English lexical stress by Chinese EFL learners and tried to unveil the underlying mechanism of the prosodic transfer from a native tonal language to a non-native stress language. However, the role of the pitch as the shared cue by lexical stress and lexical tone during the transfer remains controversial when the segmental cue (i.e., reduced vowel) is absent. By employing event-related potential (ERP) measurements, the current study aimed to further investigate the role of the pitch during the prosodic transfer from L1 lexical tone to L2 lexical stress and the underlying neural responses. Two groups of adult Chinese EFL learners were compared, as both Mandarin and Cantonese are tonal languages with different levels of complexity. The results showed that Cantonese speakers relied more than Mandarin speakers on pitch cues, not only in their processing of English lexical stress but also in word recognition. Our findings are consistent with the arguments of Cue Weighting and attest to the influence of native tonal language experience on second language acquisition. The results may have implications on pedagogical methods that pitch could be an important clue in second language teaching.												5	5											FEB	2023	13	2							202	10.3390/brainsci13020202	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci13020202												2026-01-16	WOS:000938292500001

While little effects of flat tones on sentence recognition were seen in the NH listeners when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was >= 0dB, the SNHL listeners showed decreases in flat-tone-sentence recognition in quiet and at +5-dB SNR. Such declined performance was correlated with their degrees of hearing loss. Lexical tone contributes greatly to sentence recognition in hearing-impaired listeners in both quiet and in noise listening conditions.												7	8											AUG	2019	146	2					EL99	EL105		10.1121/1.5120543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.5120543												2026-01-16	WOS:000483887400003
J	Lin, CY; Wang, M; Shu, H				Lin, Candise Y.; Wang, Min; Shu, Hua			The processing of lexical tones by young Chinese children	JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE				Article								The current study examined five-and seven-year-old Mandarin-speaking children's processing of lexical tones in relation to speech segments by varying onset and rime in an oddity task (onset +/- rime +/-). Results showed that children experienced more difficulty in lexical tone oddity judgment when rimes differed across monosyllables (e. g. onset+rime-) than when onsets differed (e. g. onset-rime+). This finding suggests that vowels interfere more than consonants in lexical tone processing. Seven-year-olds consistently outperformed five-year-olds, suggesting that the growth of metalinguistic awareness and literacy exposure may play a joint role in the development of lexical tone processing skills.												7	8											SEP	2013	40	4					885	899		10.1017/S0305000912000281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305000912000281												2026-01-16	WOS:000322447900009
J	Ren, J				Ren, Jie			Toddlers' sensitivity to segmental and suprasegmental mispronunciations of familiar words	INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT				Article								Recent research has shown that children as young as 19 months demonstrate graded sensitivity to mispronunciations in consonant onsets and vowels in word recognition tasks. This is evident in their progressively diminishing attention to relevant objects (e.g., a dog) as mispronunciations increasingly deviate from the correct word form (such as /dog/ changing to /gog/, /kog/, or /sog/). Despite these sensitivities, uncertainties remain about their broad generalizability, especially regarding the differences between word onsets and codas, and between lexical segmental (consonants and vowels) and supra-segmental (e.g., lexical stress and tones) elements. The present study aimed to fill these gaps. Using the intermodal preferential paradigm, we conducted two experiments to evaluate toddlers' responses to coda and lexical tone mispronunciations. Our results revealed a linear decline in toddlers' attention to familiar objects as mispronunciations became more severe, suggesting that by 19-20 months, infants' lexical representations encompass detailed phonetic information of both segmental and supra-segmental categories. Moreover, our results indicate that toddlers utilize these details in lexical processing. Such findings offer a more comprehensive understanding of the phonetic structures within toddlers' early lexical representations, sheding light on the mechanisms toddlers use in processing various word positions, across different acoustic dimensions, and in multiple languages.												1	1											DEC	2024	77								101999	10.1016/j.infbeh.2024.101999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2024.101999		OCT 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001348453100001
J	Tong, XL; McBride, C; Burnham, D				Tong, Xiuli; McBride, Catherine; Burnham, Denis			Cues for Lexical Tone Perception in Children: Acoustic Correlates and Phonetic Context Effects	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: The authors investigated the effects of acoustic cues (i.e., pitch height, pitch contour, and pitch onset and offset) and phonetic context cues (i.e., syllable onsets and rimes) on lexical tone perception in Cantonese-speaking children. Method: Eight minimum pairs of tonal contrasts were presented in either an identical phonetic context or in different phonetic contexts (different syllable onsets and rimes). Children were instructed to engage in tone identification and tone discrimination. Results: Cantonese children attended to pitch onset in perceiving similarly contoured tones and attended to pitch contour in perceiving different-contoured tones. There was a decreasing level of tone discrimination accuracy, with tone perception being easiest for same rime-different syllable onset, more difficult for different rime-same syllable onset, and most difficult for different rime-different syllable onset phonetic contexts. This pattern was observed in tonal contrasts in which the member tones had the same contour but not in ones in which the member tones had different contours. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in addition to pitch contour, the pitch onset is another important acoustic cue for tone perception. The relative importance of acoustic cues for tone perception is phonetically context dependent. These findings are discussed with reference to a newly modified TRACE model for tone languages (TTRACE).												38	39											OCT	2014	57	5					1589	1605		10.1044/2014_JSLHR-S-13-0145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2014_JSLHR-S-13-0145												2026-01-16	WOS:000348200500002

J	Mou, ZW; Ye, WJ; Chang, CC; Mao, YT				Mou, Zhiwei; Ye, Wujian; Chang, Chin-Chen; Mao, Yitao			The Application Analysis of Neural Network Techniques on Lexical Tone Rehabilitation of Mandarin-Speaking Patients With Post-Stroke Dysarthria	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The Objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate tone production in Mandarin-speaking patients with post-stroke dysarthria (PSD) using an artificial neural network (ANN), (2) to investigate the efficacy of recognition performance of the ANN model contrast to the human listeners and the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and (3) to explore rehabilitation application of the artificial intelligence recognition for lexical tone production disorder with PSD. The subjects include two groups of native Mandarin speaking adults: 31 patients with PSD and 42 normal-speaking adults (NA) in a similar age range as controls. Each subject was recorded producing a list of 7 Mandarin monosyllables with 4 tones (i.e., a total of 28 tokens). The fundamental frequency (F0) of each monosyllable was extracted using auto-correlation algorithm. The ANN was trained with F0 data of the tone tokens from the NA, to generate the final model. The recognition rates of the human ears, ANN model, and CNN model were 87.78 & x0025; & x00B1; 8.96 & x0025; (mean & x00B1; SD), 89.11 & x0025; & x00B1;11.80 & x0025;, 65.91 & x0025; & x00B1; 8.79 & x0025; respectively for tone production of NA group; 70.28 & x0025; & x00B1; 17.61 & x0025;, 63.35 & x0025; & x00B1; 17.40 & x0025;, 34.71 & x0025; & x00B1; 6.92 & x0025; respectively for tone production of PSD group. For PSD group, there was significant correlation between the performance of the ANN model and human listeners (r & x003D; 0.826, P & x003C; 0.001). However, the performance of CNN model was not correlated with that of the human ears (r & x003D; & x2212;0.108, P & x003D; 0.562). Thus, the experiments show that ANN is more objective and efficient, which could replace human listeners in the assessment of lexical tone production disorder in Mandarin-speaking patients with PSD. Furthermore, using ANN may reduce the heterogeneity of rehabilitation evaluation among different speech therapists and may give the feedback for achievement of rehabilitation treatment more accurately.												5	6												2020	8						90709	90717		10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994069												2026-01-16	WOS:000538727700139

This study investigated non-tone (English) and tone (Thai) language 6- to 10-month-old infants' preference for English vs. Thai one-syllable words (containing segmental and tone cues) and two-syllable words (additionally containing stress cues). A preference for their native one-syllable words was observed in each of the two groups of infants, but this was not the case for two-syllable words where Thai-learning infants showed no native-language preference. These findings indicate that as early as six months of age, infants acquiring tone- and non-tone languages identify their native language by relying solely on lexical tone cues, but tone language infants no longer show successful identification of their native language when two pitch-based cues co-occur in the signal.												0	0											JUL 3	2022	18	3					278	293		10.1080/15475441.2021.1954928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2021.1954928		AUG 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000687573900001

But how the acoustic and phonological information modulates it remains unclear. The acoustic information refers to the physical acoustic features of lexical tones, and the phonological information means the different word meanings differentiated by lexical tones. In the present study, we adopted the active oddball paradigm to explore the effects of pitch type and lexicality on native Cantonese speakers' lexical tone processing with the event related potential (ERP) technique. We used Cantonese level and contour tones (pitch type) to examine the role of acoustic information and real words and pseudowords (lexicality) to detect the phonological information's effect. The results showed that the pitch type and lexicality affected the N2b amplitudes between the left and right hemispheres interactively, while they did not play roles in P3b amplitudes. The results indicated that the acoustic and phonological information modulated the hemispheric lateralization of lexical tone processing interactively only in the early stage (N2b time window) but not in the later stage (P3b time window). The findings suggested a two-stage model interprets the hemispheric lateralization in lexical tone processing.												5	5											JUL	2022	177						83	91		10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.05.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.05.001		MAY 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000804530300001

Separability of Tones and Rhymes in Chinese Speech Perception: Evidence from Perceptual Migrations	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study used the perceptual-migration paradigm to explore whether Mandarin tones and syllable rhymes are processed separately during Mandarin speech perception. Following the logic of illusory conjunctions, we calculated the cross-ear migration of tones, rhymes, and their combination in Chinese and English listeners. For Chinese listeners, tones migrated more than rhymes. For English listeners, the opposite pattern was found. The results lend empirical support to autosegmental theory, which claims separability and mobility between tonal and segmental representations. They also provide evidence that such representations and their involvement in perception are deeply shaped by a listener's linguistic experience.												3	4											DEC	2017	60	4					562	570		10.1177/0023830916675897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830916675897												2026-01-16	WOS:000417701900003

In this study we used a dichotic listening paradigm to examine the influences of the knowledge of Jyutping (a romanization writing system which provides explicit Cantonese tone markers), linguistic-processing demand and tone type on the ear preference pattern of native tone processing in Hong Kong Cantonese speakers. While participants with little knowledge of Jyutping showed a previously reported left-ear advantage (LEA), those with a good level of Jyutping expertise exhibited either a right-ear advantage or bilateral processing during lexical tone identification and contour tone discrimination, respectively. As for the effect of linguistic-processing demand, while an LEA was found in acoustic/phonetic perception situations, this advantage disappeared and was replaced by a bilateral pattern in conditions that involved a greater extent of linguistic processing, suggesting an increased involvement of the left hemisphere. Regarding the effect of tone type, both groups showed an LEA in level tone discrimination, but only the Jyutping group demonstrated a bilateral pattern in contour tone discrimination. Overall, knowledge of written codes of tones, greater degree of linguistic processing and contour tone processing seem to influence the brain lateralization of lexical tone processing in native listeners of Cantonese by increasing the recruitment of the left-hemisphere language network.												2	2											JUL 26	2022	13								877684	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.877684	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.877684												2026-01-16	WOS:000838288600001

Electrophysiological evidence for the integral nature of tone in Mandarin spoken word recognition	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Current models of spoken word recognition have been predominantly based on studies of Indo-European languages. As a result, less is known about the recognition processes involved in the perception of tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese), and the role of lexical tone in speech perception. One view is that words in tonal languages are processed phonologically through individual segments, while another view is that they are processed lexically as a whole. Moreover, a recent study claimed to be the first to discover an early phonological processing stage in Mandarin (Huang et al., 2014). There seems to be a lack of investigations concerning tonal languages, as no clear conclusions have been reached about the nature of tonal processes, or a model of spoken word recognition that best incorporates lexical tone. The current study addressed these issues by presenting 18 native Mandarin speakers with aural sentences with medial target words. These either matched or mismatched the preceding visually presented sentences with medial target words (e.g, /jia1/home). Violation conditions involved target words that differed in the following ways: tone violation, where only the tone was different (e.g., /jia4/"price"), onset violation, where only the onset was different (e.g., /xia1/"shrimp"), and syllable violation, where both the tone and the onset were different (e.g., /tang2/"candy"). We did not find evidence for an early phonological processing stage in Mandarin. Instead, our findings indicate that Mandarin syllables are processed incrementally through phonological segments and that tone is strongly associated with lexical access. These results are discussed with respect to modifications for existing models in spoken word recognition to incorporate the processes involved with tonal language recognition.												10	11											AUG	2019	131						325	332		10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.05.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.05.031												2026-01-16	WOS:000493913900031
J	Zhang, JS; Hirose, K				Zhang, JS; Hirose, K			Tone nucleus modeling for Chinese lexical tone recognition	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								This paper presents a new scheme to deal with variations in fundamental frequency (F0) contours for lexical tone recognition in continuous Chinese speech. We divide F0 contour of a syllable into tone nucleus and adjacent articulatory transitions. We only use acoustic features of the tone nucleus for tone recognition. Tone nucleus of a syllable is assumed to be the target F0 of the associated lexical tone, and usually conforms more likely to the standard tone pattern than the articulatory transitions. A tone nucleus can be detected from a syllable F0 contour by a two-step algorithm. First, the syllable F0 contour is segmented into several linear F0 loci that serve as candidates for the tone-nucleus using segmental K-means segmentation algorithm. Then, tone nucleus is chosen from a set of candidates by a predictor based on linear discriminant analysis. Speaker dependent tone recognition experiments using tonal HMMs showed our new approach achieved an improvement of up to 6% for tone recognition rate compared with a conventional one. This indicates not only that tone-nucleus keeps important discriminant information for the lexical tones, but also that our tone-nucleus based tone recognition algorithm works properly.

Tracking the time-course of spoken word recognition of Cantonese Chinese in sentence context: Evidence from eye movements	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW				Article								In this study, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment to investigate the effects of sentence context and tonal information on spoken word recognition processes in Cantonese Chinese. We recruited 60 native Cantonese listeners to participate in the eye-tracking experiment. The target words (phonologically similar words) were manipulated to either (1) a congruent context or (2) an incongruent context in the experiment. The resulting eye-movement patterns in the incongruent context condition clearly revealed that (1) sentence context produced a garden-path effect in the initial stage of the spoken word recognition processes and then (2) the lexical tone of the word (bottom-up information) overrode the contextual effects to help listeners to discriminate between different similar-sounding words during lexical access. In conclusion, the patterns of eye-tracking data show the interactive processes between the lexical tone (an acoustic cue within a Cantonese word) and sentence context played in different phases to the spoken word recognition of Cantonese Chinese.												1	1											JUN	2024	31	3					1131	1141		10.3758/s13423-023-02397-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-023-02397-w		OCT 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001083886300002
J	Harrison, P				Harrison, P			Acquiring the phonology of lexical tone in infancy	LINGUA				Article								Phonology is bimodular: prosody (relational aspects) and melody ('phonetic' aspects) are to some extent autonomous in steady-state (adult) language. Therefore the acquisition of individual melodic and prosodic modules and their subsequent orientation with respect to one another must constitute three different developmental tasks. The acquisition of melodic primes may take place independently of any other process. If infant perception has this kind of phonological import, then disparate phonetic reflexes which are predicted as phonologically identical might show parallels in acquisition. In Government Phonology, general theory argues that the same abstract melodic objects underlie both laryngeal contrasts in stops and lexical tonal contrasts. Earlier studies show that language-specific attunement to stop contrasts has taken place by the age of six to eight months. Tests on lexical tone perception are now reported, using both adults and infants. The results show that at around six months of age, babies acquiring Yoruba, a language which has a three-way contrast for tone, attend more closely to pitch changes within the minimal domain word than do English controls. Further, they only attend to those pitch changes that possess phonological import within that domain in the steady-state language. In this their perception exactly parallels that displayed by the adult speakers. Finally, both adults and infants display a particular asymmetry in perception in that they discriminate the high/mid tone distinction but fail to perceive the mid/low contrast where no linguistic context is present. This was not predicted at the onset of testing, but it is argued that it may well have a phonological explanation, which could align this finding with the typological asymmetries to be found in the distribution of lexical tone in Yoruba and other west African languages.

J	Lu, HH; Che, WC; Yang, YH; Tsao, FM				Lu, Hsin-Hui; Che, Wei-Chun; Yang, Yung-Hao; Tsao, Feng-Ming			Exploring word-referent mapping in Mandarin-speaking late-talkers at 33 months and its language predictors at 27 months: An eye-tracking study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS				Article								Background and Aims This longitudinal study investigated the language skills, phonological working memory and lexical-tone perception of Mandarin-speaking late-talkers (LTs) and those with typical language development (TLD) at 27 months, while also examining their connections with novel word-referent mapping (W-R mapping) through eye-tracking at 33 months. Methods and Procedures Participants included 22 Mandarin-speaking 27-month-old LTs and 22 toddlers with TLD. Data on expressive and receptive language abilities, as well as phonological working memory and lexical-tone perception, were collected when participants were 27 months old. An eye-tracking paradigm was further employed during the word-learning tasks, which included W-R mapping and word-identification test (W-I test) phases at 33 months. Multilevel models were used to analyse participants' gaze pattern trajectories. Outcomes and Results At 27 months, LT toddlers exhibited poorer language skills (receptive: p = 0.015, expressive: p < 0.001), lexical-tone perception (p < 0.001) and phonological working memory (p < 0.001) compared to those with TLD, even after considering maternal educational level and participants' fine motor ability. During the W-I test phase, we observed that LT toddlers showed a slower increase in fixations on the novel target image while listening to the corresponding novel word over time, compared to TLD toddlers (linear: p = 0.011, quadratic: p = 0.007) after adding confounders. Further, expressive language ability at 27 months old was a predictor of their newly established W-R mappings at 33 months old (p = 0.016). Additionally, the toddler's phonological working memory and lexical-tone perception were associated with their expressive language ability (p = 0.001 and < 0.001). Conclusions and Implications These findings indicate that the novel W-R mapping is not as robust in LTs as in TLDs, and the skills necessary for word learning share similarities with a wide range of expressive language abilities. Moreover, poor expressive language abilities were associated with deficits in lexical processing abilities; that is, phonological working memory and lexical-tone perception. These findings suggest the need for interventions aimed at improving LTs' lexical processing abilities to strengthen their lagging word-learning skills at toddlerhood.												1	1											NOV	2024	59	6					2671	2685		10.1111/1460-6984.13107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.13107		AUG 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001299127300001
J	Liang, BS; Li, YC; Zhao, WY; Du, Y				Liang, Baishen; Li, Yanchang; Zhao, Wanying; Du, Yi			Bilateral human laryngeal motor cortex in perceptual decision of lexical tone and voicing of consonant	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				Article								Speech perception is believed to recruit the left motor cortex. However, the exact role of the laryngeal subregion and its right counterpart in speech perception, as well as their temporal patterns of involvement remain unclear. To address these questions, we conducted a hypothesis-driven study, utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation on the left or right dorsal laryngeal motor cortex (dLMC) when participants performed perceptual decision on Mandarin lexical tone or consonant (voicing contrast) presented with or without noise. We used psychometric function and hierarchical drift-diffusion model to disentangle perceptual sensitivity and dynamic decision-making parameters. Results showed that bilateral dLMCs were engaged with effector specificity, and this engagement was left-lateralized with right upregulation in noise. Furthermore, the dLMC contributed to various decision stages depending on the hemisphere and task difficulty. These findings substantially advance our understanding of the hemispherical lateralization and temporal dynamics of bilateral dLMC in sensorimotor integration during speech perceptual decision-making. The role of the laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) in speech perception is poorly understood. Here, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, the authors found a causal contribution of bilateral LMC to consonant and lexical tone perception.												5	6											AUG 5	2023	14	1							4710	10.1038/s41467-023-40445-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40445-0												2026-01-16	WOS:001043364000007

Design: Four groups of subjects participated in the study, including 20 normal-hearing, 20 moderately, 20 moderately to severely, and 8 severely hearing-impaired listeners. The original speech materials consisted of 16 sets of Mandarin monosyllables spoken by a male and a female. Each monosyllable had four tonal patterns, resulting in a total of 64 combinations of consonants, vowels, and tones. A Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) algorithm was used to create two sets of synthesized materials, including 128 tokens with the original spectral fine structure mixed with the spectral envelope from a different tone, as well as 128 tokens with noise fine structure and the original spectral envelope. All subjects participated in tone recognition tests using the two sets of chimeric tone tokens. Oral responses to tones were recorded and scored as percent correct. Results: Hearing-impaired listeners could take advantage of spectral fine structure in the recognition of lexical tones, but with increasing hearing loss, the ability of hearing-impaired listeners to recognize tones became worse, especially for severely hearing-impaired listeners. Hearing-impaired listeners showed significant differences in tone recognition between the male and female voices. Tone 3 was the easiest tone to perceive, followed by tone 2, whereas tones 1 and 4 were hard for all subjects, particularly when only the spectral envelope cue was available. Hearing-impaired listeners showed a significantly lower level of lexical tone recognition than normal-hearing listeners when using spectral envelope cues in comparison with normal-hearing listeners. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the spectral fine structure cue dominates lexical tone recognition for all subjects. Listeners with sensorineural hearing impairment showed reduced ability in the recognition of lexical tones using both spectral fine structure and spectral envelope cues, which may result from their impaired auditory spectral resolution.												12	17											FEB	2011	32	1					97	103															2026-01-16	WOS:000285581300011

Forty-one native Mandarin-Chinese-speaking listeners participated in the experiments. Results showed that sine-wave tone-recognition performance was on average only 32.7% correct. However, sine-wave sentence-recognition performance was very accurate, approximately 92% correct on average. Therefore the functional load of lexical tones on sentence recognition is limited, and the high-level recognition of sine-wave sentences is likely attributed to the perceptual organization that is influenced by top-down processes.

J	Lu, HH; Liu, HH; Tsao, FM				Lu, Hsin-Hui; Liu, Hong-Hsiang; Tsao, Feng-Ming			Event-related potentials of familiar monosyllabic words with unexpected lexical tones: A picture-word study of Mandarin-speaking preschoolers with and without a history of late talking	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE				Article								This study examined how Mandarin-speaking preschoolers with and without a history of late talking (LT) process familiar monosyllabic words with unexpected lexical tones, focusing on both phonological and semantic violations. This study initially enrolled 64 Mandarin-speaking toddlers: 31 with a history of LT (mean age: 27.67 months) and 33 without a history of LT (non-LT) (mean age: 27.85 months). Event-related potentials were recorded at the age of 4 years during a picture-word mismatch task (LT mean age: 51.36 months; non-LT mean age: 51.20 months); in this task, the participants were presented with auditory words either matching (Tone 3) or mismatching with images in terms of their lexical tones; the mismatches encompassed acoustically dissimilar (Tone 1) and similar (Tone 2) mismatches. A significant difference in the phonological mapping negativity (PMN) responses to Tones 1 and 3 was observed only in the non-LT group. However, differences in the N400 responses to Tones 1 and 3 remained consistent across both groups. In addition, greater differences in the PMN responses between Tones 1 and 3 were associated with higher language proficiency during the preschool period. The PMN response serves as an indicator of neural correlates in lexical tone processing, reflecting challenges encountered by preschoolers with a history of LT when processing the lexical tones of familiar words. Furthermore, the PMN response was correlated with concurrent language abilities. These findings indicate the importance of early tonal perception development for Mandarin speakers with a history of LT.Research Highlights Preschoolers with a history of late talking (LT), similar to preschoolers without such a history, can establish word expectations and detect the lexical tone violation in real time. However, those with a history of LT require additional time to process acoustic cues and differentiate between word semantics based on lexical tone information. The phonological mapping negativity response serves as an indicator of neural correlates in lexical tone processing, reflecting challenges encountered by preschoolers with a history of LT when processing the lexical tones of familiar words. The present findings indicate the importance of early intervention for Mandarin speakers with a history of LT, with an emphasis on lexical tone processing from toddlerhood.												0	0											NOV	2024	27	6								10.1111/desc.13553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/desc.13553		AUG 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001285371900001

The present ERP study investigated whether the distinct pitch processing pattern for speech and nonspeech stimuli in autism was due to a speech-specific deficit in categorical perception of lexical tones. A passive oddball paradigm was adopted to examine two groups (16 in the autism group and 15 in the control group) of Chinese children's Mismatch Responses (MMRs) to equivalent pitch deviations representing within-category and between-category differences in speech and nonspeech contexts. To further examine group-level differences in the MMRs to categorical perception of speech/nonspeech stimuli or lack thereof, neural oscillatory activities at the single trial level were further calculated with the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measure for the theta and beta frequency bands. The MMR and ITPC data from the children with autism showed evidence for lack of categorical perception in the lexical tone condition. In view of the important role of lexical tones in acquiring a tonal language, the results point to the necessity of early intervention for the individuals with autism who show such a speech-specific categorical perception deficit.												110	115											FEB 22	2017	7						1	12	43254	10.1038/srep43254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep43254												2026-01-16	WOS:000394745800001

Lexical tone activation during unconscious translation: Evidence from Mandarin-English bilinguals	COGNITION				Article								Although lexical tone is a highly prevalent phonetic cue in human languages, its role in bilingual spoken word recognition is not well understood. The present study investigates whether and how adult bilinguals, who use pitch contours to disambiguate lexical items in one language but not the other, access a tonal 1,1 when exclusively processing a non-tonal L2. Using the visual world paradigm, we show that Mandarin-English listeners automatically activated Mandarin translation equivalents of English target words such as 'rain' (Mandarin 'yu3'), and consequently were distracted by competitors whose segments and tones overlapped with the translations of English target words ('feather', also 'yu3' in Mandarin). Importantly, listeners were not distracted by competitors that overlapped with the translations of target words in all segments but not tone ('fish'; Mandarin 'yu2'), nor were they distracted by competitors that overlapped with the translations of target words in rime and tone ('wheat', Mandarin 'gu3'). These novel results demonstrate implicit access to L1 lexical representations through automatic/unconscious translation, as a result of cross-language top-down and/or lateral influence, and highlight the critical role of lexical tone activation in bilingual lexical access.

Evidence from perceptual switching	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Bilinguals have the sole option of conversing in one language in spite of knowing two languages. The question of how bilinguals alternate between their two languages, activating and deactivating one language, is not well understood. In the current study, we investigated the development of this process by researching bilingual children's abilities to selectively integrate lexical tone based on its relevance in the language being used. In particular, the current study sought to determine the effects of global conversation-level cues versus local (within-word phonotactic) cues on children's tone integration in newly learned words. Words were taught to children via a conversational narrative, and word recognition was investigated using the intermodal preferential-looking paradigm. Children were tested on recognition of words with stimuli that were either matched or. mismatched in tone in both English and Mandarin conversations. Results demonstrated that 3- to 4-year-olds did not adapt their interpretation of lexical tone changes to the language being spoken. In contrast, 4- to 5-year-olds were able to do so when supported by informative within-word cues. Results suggest that preschool children are capable of selectively activating a single language given word-internal cues to language. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Individual differences in nonnative lexical tone perception: Effects of tone language repertoire and musical experience	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This study sought to understand the effects of tone language repertoire and musical experience on nonnative lexical tone perception and production. Thirty-one participants completed a tone discrimination task, an imitation task, and a musical abilities task. Results showed that a larger tone language repertoire and musical experience both enhanced tone discrimination performance. However, the effects were not additive, as musical experience was associated with tone discrimination performance for single-tone language speakers, but such association was not seen for dual-tone language speakers. Furthermore, among single-tone language speakers, but not among dual-tone language speakers, musical experience and musical aptitude positively correlated with tone discrimination accuracy. It is thus concluded that individuals with varying extents of tone language experience may adopt different strategies when performing tone discrimination tasks; single-tone language speakers may draw on their musical expertise while dual-tone language speakers may rely on their extensive tone language experience instead.												7	7											SEP 29	2022	13								940363	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.940363	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.940363												2026-01-16	WOS:000868161800001

While lexical tone predominates as a source of phonemic contrast in human languages, there has been little investigation of the influences of lexical tone on word learning. The present study investigates infants' sensitivity to tone mispronunciations in two groups of infants. For one group (Chinese learners), tone is phonemic in their native language, and for the second group (English learners), tone is non-phonemic and constituted suprasegmental variation. In Experiment 1, English learners were trained on novel word-object pairings and tested on their recognition of correct pronunciations, tone and vowel mispronunciations of these words at 18 and 24months. In Experiment 2a, bilingual English-Chinese learners were tested on a similar task translated into Chinese at the same age intervals. Results demonstrate that non-tonal learners treated tonal and vowel substitutions alike as mispronunciations at 18months but only treated vowel substitutions as mispronunciations at 24months. Tonal learners treated both tonal and vowel substitutions as mispronunciations at both ages. In Experiment 2b, bilingual non-tone language learners were tested on the same set of tasks replicating a similar set of results as monolingual non-tone language learners (Experiment 1). Findings point to an early predisposition to treat tone as a defining characteristic of words regardless of its lexical relevance at 18months. Between 18 and 24months, learners appear to ascribe lexical relevance to tone in a language-specific manner. The current study identifies the influences of tone variation on memories for newly learned words and the time period during which lexical tone - a highly frequent constituent of human languages - actually becomes lexical for early learners. Findings are contextualized with prevailing models of the developing lexicon.												67	71											JAN	2014	17	1					94	109		10.1111/desc.12097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/desc.12097												2026-01-16	WOS:000328578100010

Here, speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured in steady noise or competing speech in Mandarin-speaking CI and normal-hearing (NH) children. CI children were more susceptible to informational masking and were unable to use F0 cues to segregate talkers. SRTs were significantly correlated with chronological age in NH children and with duration of deafness in CI children, suggesting that auditory deprivation may limit developmental processes important for talker segregation.

There was no significant correlation between tone recognition ability and either implant age or chronological age at two evaluation points. Further analysis revealed that the tone recognition score for tone pair 2-3 was significantly lower than that for other tone pairs except for tone pair 2-4.Conclusions: Longer CI experience can significantly improve tone recognition ability in CI children between 2 and 3 years post CI activation.												1	1											FEB	2023	165								111444	10.1016/j.ijporl.2023.111444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2023.111444		JAN 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000919851900001

Here, we demonstrate that early auditory processing of a lexical tone at a preattentive stage is actually lateralized to the right hemisphere. We frequently presented to native Mandarin Chinese speakers a meaningful auditory word with a consonant-vowel structure and infrequently varied either its lexical tone or initial consonant using an odd-ball paradigm to create a contrast resulting in a change in word meaning. The lexical tone contrast evoked a stronger preattentive response, as revealed by whole-head electric recordings of the mismatch negativity, in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere, whereas the consonant contrast produced an opposite pattern. Given the distinct acoustic features between a lexical tone and a consonant, this opposite lateralization pattern suggests the dependence of hemisphere dominance mainly on acoustic cues before speech input is mapped into a semantic representation in the processing stream.												122	145											DEC 19	2006	103	51					19558	19563		10.1073/pnas.0607065104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0607065104												2026-01-16	WOS:000243166600061

Perception of tone and aspiration contrasts in Chinese children with dyslexia	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY				Article								Previous research has shown a relationship between speech perception and dyslexia in alphabetic writing. In these studies speech perception was measured using phonemes, a prominent feature of alphabetic languages. Given the primary importance of lexical tone in Chinese language processing, we tested the extent to which lexical tone and aspiration, two fundamental dimensions of Cantonese speech not represented in writing, would distinguish dyslexic from non-dyslexic 8-year-old Chinese children. Tone and aspiration were tested in addition to other phonological processing skills across groups to determine the importance of different aspects of phonological sensitivity in relation to reading disability. Dyslexic children and age-matched and reading-level controls were tested on their categorical perception of minimal pairs contrasting in tone and aspiration, phonological awareness, rapid digit naming, and Chinese reading abilities. While performing similarly to reading-level controls, dyslexic children perceived tone and aspiration contrasts less categorically and accurately than age-matched controls. They also performed more poorly than the age-matched controls on rapid digit naming and a measure of phonological awareness testing children's sensitivity to different grain size units. Dyslexia in non-alphabetic Chinese correlates with the categorical organization and accuracy of Cantonese speech perception, along the tone and aspiration dimensions. This association with reading is mediated by its association with phonological awareness. Therefore, dyslexia is universally at least partly a function of basic speech and phonological processes independent of whether the speech dimensions in question are coded in writing.												62	71											JUN	2009	50	6					726	733		10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02001.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02001.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000266027300009
J	Huang, WT; Liu, C; Dong, Q; Nan, Y				Huang, Wan-Ting; Liu, Chang; Dong, Qi; Nan, Yun			Categorical perception of lexical tones in mandarin-speaking congenital amusics	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Previous research suggests that within Mandarin-speaking congenital amusics, only a subgroup has behavioral lexical tone perception impairments (tone agnosia), whereas the rest of amusics do not. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the categorical nature of lexical tone perception in Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without behavioral lexical tone deficits. Three groups of listeners (controls, pure amusics, and amusics with tone agnosia) participated in tone identification and discrimination tasks. Indexes of the categorical perception (GP) of a physical continuum of fundamental frequencies ranging from a rising to level tone were measured. Specifically, the stimulus durations were manipulated at 100 and 200 ms. For both stimulus durations, all groups exhibited similar categorical boundaries. The pure amusics showed sharp identification slopes and significantly peaked discrimination functions similar to those of normal controls. However, such essential characteristics for the GP of lexical tones were not observed in amusics with tone agnosia. An enlarged step-size from 20 to 35 Hz was not able to produce any discrimination peaks in tone agnosics either. The current study revealed that only amusics with tone agnosia showed a lack of categorical tone perception, while the pure amusics demonstrated typical GP of lexical tones, indicating that the deficit of pitch processing in music does not necessarily result in the deficit in the GP of lexical tones. The different performance between congenital amusics with and without tone agnosia provides a new perspective on the proposition of the relationship between music and speech perception.												29	32											JUN 16	2015	6								829	10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00829	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00829												2026-01-16	WOS:000356949500001

Method: Fifty-three adult listeners completed a Mandarin tone perception task with 720 tone stimuli in auditory-only (AO), auditory-facial (AF), and auditory-facial-plus-gestural (AFG) modalities, at fast, normal, and slow speech rates under quiet and noisy conditions. In AF and AFG modalities, both congruent and incongruent audiovisual information were designed and presented. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were constructed to analyze the accuracy of tone perception across different conditions. Results: In Mandarin tone perception, the magnitude of enhancement of AF and AFG cues across three speech rates was significantly higher than that of the AO cue in the adverse context of noise, yet additional metaphoric gestures did not show significant differences from the facial information. Furthermore, the performance of auditory tone perception at the fast speech rate was significantly better than that at the normal speech rate when the inputs were incongruent between auditory and visual channels in quiet. Conclusions: This study provided compelling evidence showing that integrated audiovisual information plays a vital role not only in improving lexical tone perception in noise but also in modulating the effects of speech rate on Mandarin tone perception in quiet for native listeners. Our findings, supporting the theory of embodied cognition, are implicational for speech and hearing rehabilitation among both young and old clinical populations.												10	11											NOV	2022	65	11					4385	4403		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00024												2026-01-16	WOS:000891439000026

Advanced Second Language Learners of Mandarin Show Persistent Deficits for Lexical Tone Encoding in Picture-to-Word Form Matching	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION				Article								People who grow up speaking a language without lexical tones typically find it difficult to master tonal languages after childhood. Accumulating research suggests that much of the challenge for these second language (L2) speakers has to do not with identification of the tones themselves, but with the bindings between tones and lexical units. The question that remains open is how much of these lexical binding problems are problems of encoding (incomplete knowledge of the tone-to-word relations) vs. retrieval (failure to access those relations in online processing). While recent work using lexical decision tasks suggests that both may play a role, one issue is that failure on a lexical decision task may reflect a lack of learner confidence about what is not a word, rather than non-native representation or processing of known words. Here we provide complementary evidence using a picture-phonology matching paradigm in Mandarin in which participants decide whether or not a spoken target matches a specific image, with concurrent event-related potential (ERP) recording to provide potential insight into differences in L1 and L2 tone processing strategies. As in the lexical decision case, we find that advanced L2 learners show a clear disadvantage in accurately identifying tone mismatched targets relative to vowel mismatched targets. We explore the contribution of incomplete/uncertain lexical knowledge to this performance disadvantage by examining individual data from an explicit tone knowledge post-test. Results suggest that explicit tone word knowledge and confidence explains some but not all of the errors in picture-phonology matching. Analysis of ERPs from correct trials shows some differences in the strength of L1 and L2 responses, but does not provide clear evidence toward differences in processing that could explain the L2 disadvantage for tones. In sum, these results converge with previous evidence from lexical decision tasks in showing that advanced L2 listeners continue to have difficulties with lexical tone recognition, and in suggesting that these difficulties reflect problems both in encoding lexical tone knowledge and in retrieving that knowledge in real time.												10	10											JUN 22	2021	6								689423	10.3389/fcomm.2021.689423	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2021.689423												2026-01-16	WOS:000672133300001

Method: In two experiments, participants were audibly presented with a target word and visually presented with the same target word, a tonal competitor, and two distractors, and they were required to identify the target word. In Experi-ment 1, the two tonal competitors shared either acoustically highly similar tones (e.g., target word: "(sic)" /yang2tai2/, "balcony" vs. competitor: "offspring" /yang3zi3/, "adopted son") or acoustically lowly similar tones (e.g., target word: "(sic)" /yang2tai2/, "balcony" vs. competitor: "" /yang4ben3/, "sample"). In Experiment 2, the acoustic similarity of the target words and the tonal competi-tors shared either acoustically highly similar tones or acoustically lowly similar tones or identical tones (e.g., target word: "(sic)" /yang2tai2/, "balcony" vs. competitor: "(sic)" /yang2mao2/, "wool"). Results: The results of the two experiments consistently demonstrated a graded tonal competitor effect, in which acoustically highly similar tonal com-petitors attracted more visual attention than acoustically lowly similar tonal competitors. Conclusion: Tonal similarity plays a graded constraining role in spoken word recognition in Mandarin Chinese.												2	2											SEP	2023	66	9					3453	3472		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00297												2026-01-16	WOS:001145884300009

Previous research on speech recalibration has primarily focused on segmental variation, demonstrating that recalibration tends to be specific to individual speakers and situations and often persists over time. In this study, we present findings on the perceptual learning of lexical tone in Standard Chinese, a suprasegmental feature signaled primarily through pitch variations to distinguish morpheme/word meanings. Native speakers of Standard Chinese showed a recalibration of tone category boundaries immediately following exposure to ambiguous tonal pitch contours. However, this recalibration effect significantly weakened after 12 hours. Furthermore, participants trained at night did not exhibit delayed stabilization, a phenomenon commonly observed during sleep-induced consolidation. Our results replicate previous findings and provide new evidence suggesting that while our perceptual system can flexibly adapt to real-time sensory inputs, subsequent consolidation processes, such as those occurring during sleep, may exhibit selectivity and, under certain conditions, may be ineffective.												0	0											2024 DEC 18	2024										10.1177/00238309241291536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00238309241291536		DEC 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001380098000001

The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of residual hair cell function for speech and music perception in bimodal pediatric Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant (CI) listeners. Design. Speech and music performance was measured in 35 Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI users for unilateral (CI-only) and bimodal listening. Mandarin speech perception was measured for vowels, consonants, lexical tones, and sentences in quiet. Music perception was measured for melodic contour identification (MCI). Results. Combined electric and acoustic hearing significantly improved MCI and Mandarin tone recognition performance, relative to CI-only performance. For MCI, performance was significantly better with bimodal listening for all semitone spacing conditions (p < 0 05 in all cases). For tone recognition, bimodal performance was significantly better only for tone 2 (rising; p < 0 05). There were no significant differences between CI-only and CI + HA for vowel, consonant, or sentence recognition. Conclusions. The results suggest that combined electric and acoustic hearing can significantly improve perception of music and Mandarin tones in pediatric Mandarin-speaking CI patients. Music and lexical tone perception depends strongly on pitch perception, and the contralateral acoustic hearing coming from residual hair cell function provided pitch cues that are generally not well preserved in electric hearing.												27	30												2018	2018								4610592	10.1155/2018/4610592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/4610592												2026-01-16	WOS:000431227600001

Aims: The present study aimed to examine the roles of pitch gesture production (PP), pitch feature observation (PO), and word-picture association (WA) approach in L2 lexical tone learning. S ample: Participants were 90 undergraduate students with Mandarin as their native language. Methods: Participants learned Thai lexical tones via the three approaches and completed tone discrimination, tone identification, and word-picture matching tasks. Results: The PP performed better than the PO and WA in discriminating between and identifying specific tones. The PP was more accurate than the WA in word-picture matching. Conclusions: The pitch gesture production's embodiment was superior to the pitch feature observation's conceptual metaphor in learning L2 lexical tones. However, its role was affected by lexical tones' pitch features, test tasks, and learners' tonal experience.												5	5											AUG	2024	92								101905	10.1016/j.learninstruc.2024.101905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2024.101905		MAR 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001216418600001

Non-native Speech Learning in Older Adults	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Though there is an extensive literature investigating the ability of younger adults to learn non-native phonology, including investigations into individual differences in younger adults' lexical tone learning, very little is known about older adults' ability to learn non-native phonology, including lexical tone. There are several reasons to suspect that older adults would use different learning mechanisms when learning lexical tone than younger adults, including poorer perception of dynamic pitch, greater reliance on working memory capacity in second language learning, and poorer category learning in older adulthood. The present study examined the relationships among older adults' baseline sensitivity for pitch patterns, working memory capacity, and declarative memory capacity with their ability to learn to associate tone with lexical meaning. In older adults, baseline pitch pattern sensitivity was not associated with generalization performance. Rather, older adults' learning performance was best predicted by declarative memory capacity. These data suggest that training paradigms will need to be modified to optimize older adults' non-native speech sound learning success.												14	16											FEB 10	2017	8								148	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00148	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00148												2026-01-16	WOS:000393640200001
J	Klein, D; Zatorre, RJ; Milner, B; Zhao, V				Klein, D; Zatorre, RJ; Milner, B; Zhao, V			A cross-linguistic PET study of tone perception in mandarin Chinese and English speakers	NEUROIMAGE				Article								PET was used in a cross-linguistic study to determine whether neural mechanisms subserving pitch perception differ as a function of linguistic relevance. We compared tone perception in 12 native Mandarin speakers, who use tonal patterns to distinguish lexical meaning, with that of 12 native speakers of a nontone language, English. Subjects were scanned under two conditions: a silent resting baseline and a tonal task involving discrimination of pitch patterns in Mandarin words. Both groups showed common regions of CBF increase, but only Mandarin speakers showed additional activation in frontal, parietal, and parietooccipital regions of the left hemisphere; this latter finding indicates that language experience may influence brain circuitry in the processing of auditory cues. In contrast, only the English group showed activity in the right inferior frontal cortex, consistent with a right-hemispheric role in pitch perception.

J	Liu, LQ; Chen, A; Kager, R				Liu, Liquan; Chen, Ao; Kager, Rene			Simultaneous bilinguals who do not speak a tone language show enhancement in pitch sensitivity but not in executive function	LINGUISTIC APPROACHES TO BILINGUALISM				Article								Previous studies have reported perceptual advantages, such as when discriminating non-native linguistic or musical pitch differences, among first-year infants growing up in bilingual over monolingual environments. It is unclear whether such effects should be attributed to bilinguals' enhanced perceptual sensitivity and/or cognitive abilities, and whether such effects would extend to adulthood. Twenty-four Dutch, 24 Dutch simultaneous bilingual (DSB), and 24 Chinese Mandarin speakers were examined by three sets of tasks assessing their linguistic pitch and music perception, executive function, as well as interactions across these modalities. Results showed degrees of advantages for DSB and Chinese participants' over their Dutch peers in lexical tone discrimination and pitch-related music tasks. In tasks related to executive function, no difference was observed between DSB and Dutch participants, while Chinese participants' performances were modulated by cognitive interference of language processing. Findings suggest that listeners' enhanced sensitivity to linguistic and musical pitch may stem from acoustic (DSB) and experience (Chinese) rather than cognitive factors. Moreover, Dutch participants showed robust correlations between their linguistic and musical pitch perception, followed by limited correlations in DSB, and virtually no correlation among Chinese participants, illustrating how distinct language experiences can lead to specific pitch perception patterns between language and music.												6	7											JUN 14	2022	12	3					310	346		10.1075/lab.19037.liu	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/lab.19037.liu												2026-01-16	WOS:000812104700003

Therefore, native tone language alaryngeal speakers encountering difficulty imparting lexical tone variation would suffer loss of speech intelligibility. This study examines the intelligibility of lexical tone produced by four different alaryngeal speech methods, namely: oesophageal speech, electrolarynx, a pneumatic device and tracheo-oesophageal speech. Isolated and embedded monosyllabic Chinese words produced by 53 alaryngeal speakers were presented to three normally hearing young adult listeners with no prior exposure to laryngectomy speech. The listeners transcribed the speech orthographically. Significant differences were found in the intelligibility level between the different speech methods. Listeners' responses were also pooled together and analysed for tone and segmental errors. Errors of tone alone were found to occur more often than segmental errors.												19	23												1994	29	4					339	347															2026-01-16	WOS:A1994PX60600003
J	Zhang, H; Dai, XQ; Ma, W; Ding, HW; Zhang, Y				Zhang, Hao; Dai, Xuequn; Ma, Wen; Ding, Hongwei; Zhang, Yang			Investigating Perception to Production Transfer in Children With Cochlear Implants: A High Variability Phonetic Training Study	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: This study builds upon an established effective training method to investigate the advantages of high variability phonetic identification training for enhancing lexical tone perception and production in Mandarin -speaking pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients, who typically face ongoing challenges in these areas. Method: Thirty-two Mandarin -speaking children with CIs were quasirandomly assigned into the training group (TG) and the control group (CG). The 16 TG participants received five sessions of high variability phonetic training (HVPT) within a period of 3 weeks. The CG participants did not receive the training. Perception and production of Mandarin tones were administered before (pretest) and immediately after (posttest) the completion of HVPT via lexical tone recognition task and picture naming task. Both groups participated in the identical pretest and posttest with the same time frame between the two test sessions. Results: TG showed significant improvement from pretest to posttest in identifying Mandarin tones for both trained and untrained speech stimuli. Moreover, perceptual learning of HVPT significantly facilitated trainees' production of T1 and T2 as rated by a cohort of 10 Mandarin -speaking adults with normal hearing, which was corroborated by acoustic analyses revealing improved fundamental frequency (F0) median for T1 and T2 production and enlarged F0 movement for T2 production. In contrast, TG children's production of T3 and T4 showed nonsignificant changes across two test sessions. Meanwhile, CG did not exhibit significant changes in either perception or production. Conclusions: The results suggest a limited and inconsistent transfer of perceptual learning to lexical tone production in children with CIs, which challenges the notion of a robust transfer and highlights the complexity of the interaction between perceptual training and production outcomes. Further research on individual differences with a longitudinal design is needed to optimize the training protocol or tailor interventions to better meet the diverse needs of learners.												13	16											APR	2024	67	4					1206	1228		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-23-00573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-23-00573												2026-01-16	WOS:001244512900014
J	Cabrera, L; Liu, HM; Granjon, L; Kao, C; Tsao, FM				Cabrera, Laurianne; Liu, Huei-Mei; Granjon, Lionel; Kao, Chieh; Tsao, Feng-Ming			Discrimination and identification of lexical tones and consonants in Mandarin-speaking children using cochlear implants	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Mandarin-speaking adults using cochlear implants (CI) experience more difficulties in perceiving lexical tones than consonants. This problem may result from the fact that CIs provide relatively sufficient temporal envelope information for consonant perception in quiet environments, but do not convey the fine spectro-temporal information considered to be necessary for accurate pitch perception. Another possibility is that Mandarin speakers with post-lingual hearing loss have developed language-specific use of these acoustic cues, impeding lexical tone processing under CI conditions. To investigate this latter hypothesis, syllable discrimination and word identification abilities for Mandarin consonants (place and manner) and lexical-tone contrasts (tones 1 vs 3 and 1 vs 2) were measured in 15 Mandarin-speaking children using CIs and age-matched children with normal hearing (NH). In the discrimination task, only children using CIs exhibited significantly lower scores for consonant place contrasts compared to other contrasts, including lexical tones. In the word identification task, children using CIs showed lower performance for all contrasts compared to children with NH, but they both showed specific difficulties with tone 1 vs 2 contrasts. This study suggests that Mandarin-speaking children using CIs are able to discriminate and identify lexical tones and, perhaps more surprisingly, have more difficulties when discriminating consonants.

These invariant features constitute so-called abstract auditory rules. Our previous study has shown that with auditory sensory intelligence, the human brain can automatically extract the abstract auditory rules in the speech sound stream, presumably serving as the neural basis for speech comprehension. However, whether the sensory intelligence for extraction of abstract auditory rules in speech is inherent or experience-dependent remains unclear. To address this issue, we constructed a complex speech sound stream using auditory materials in Mandarin Chinese, in which syllables had a flat lexical tone but differed in other acoustic features to form an abstract auditory rule. This rule was occasionally and randomly violated by the syllables with the rising, dipping or falling tone. We found that both Chinese and foreign speakers detected the violations of the abstract auditory rule in the speech sound stream at a pre-attentive stage, as revealed by the whole-head recordings of mismatch negativity (MMN) in a passive paradigm. However, MMNs peaked earlier in Chinese speakers than in foreign speakers. Furthermore, Chinese speakers showed different MMN peak latencies for the three deviant types, which paralleled recognition points. These findings indicate that the sensory intelligence for extraction of abstract auditory rules in speech sounds is innate but shaped by language experience. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, research comparing and contrasting behavioral and electrophysiological responses to this stimulus type is scarce. Design: Two sets of chimeric stimuli were constructed by interchanging the envelopes and fine-structures of the rising/yi(2)/and falling/yi(4)/Mandarin pitch contours that were filtered through 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 frequency banks. Behavioral pitch-perception tasks were administered through a two-alternative, forced-choice paradigm. Electrophysiological responses were measured through scalp-recorded frequency-following responses (FFRs) to the lexical-tone chimeras. Study sample: Twenty American and twenty Chinese adults were recruited. Results: A two-way analysis of variance showed significance (p<0.05) within and across the filter bank and language background factors for the behavioral measurements, while the frequency-following response demonstrated a significance only across the filter banks. Conclusions: Perceptual importance of envelope cues increases starting from 16 filter banks, while the FFR accuracy and magnitude decreases with increasing number of filter banks. These results can be useful in assessing experience-dependent neuroplasticity and in designing speech processing strategies for cochlear-implant users who speak tonal or non-tonal languages around the globe.												3	4											JAN 2	2016	55	1					53	63		10.3109/14992027.2015.1072774	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/14992027.2015.1072774												2026-01-16	WOS:000365589500007
J	Zhang, CC; Chen, S				Zhang, Caicai; Chen, Si			Toward an Integrative Model of Talker Normalization	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE				Article								Successful speech perception requires accurate mapping of speech signals to linguistic categories despite talker variation in signals. Although factors like intrinsic and context cues have been identified, a full understanding of talker normalization remains to be achieved. In particular, it is important to examine the cocontribution of intrinsic, extrinsic and other cues in an integrative way. In Experiment 1, we examined the effect of intrinsic cues and typicality of a talker's F0 range relative to population F0 range on word identification in isolation. In Experiment 2, we compared the effects of 4 contexts to identify those that consistently facilitate talker normalization. We found that without contexts, word identification accuracy was low and variable depending on talker typicality. Contexts improved performance across all talkers regardless of typicality. But only meaningless and meaningful speech contexts with cues to a talker's acoustic-phonological space showed consistent effects. We proposed a new model, integrating talker typicality, talker familiarity, and context. Whereas speech signals from familiar or typical talkers may be accurately identified standing alone, a context with cues to a talker's acoustic-phonological space is necessary in the case of unfamiliar and atypical talkers. It is thus the first model that integrates memory and context effects.												32	35											AUG	2016	42	8					1252	1268		10.1037/xhp0000216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xhp0000216												2026-01-16	WOS:000383108600016
J	Lu, S; Wayland, R; Kaan, E				Lu, Shuang; Wayland, Ratree; Kaan, Edith			Effects of production training and perception training on lexical tone perception - A behavioral and ERP study	BRAIN RESEARCH				Article								The present study recorded both behavioral data and event-related brain potentials to examine the effectiveness of a perception-only training and a perception-plus-production training procedure on the intentional and unintentional perception of lexical tone by native English listeners. In the behavioral task, both the perception-only and the perception-plus-production groups improved on the tone discrimination abilities after the training session. Moreover, the participants in both groups generalized the improvements gained through the trained stimuli to the untrained stimuli. In the ERP task, the Mismatch Negativity was smaller in the post-training task than in the pre-training task. However, the two training groups did not differ in tone processing at the intentional or unintentional level after training. These results suggest that the employment of the motor system does not specifically benefit the tone perceptual skills. Furthermore, the present study investigated whether some tone pairs are more easily confused than others by native English listeners, and whether the order of tone presentation influences non-native tone discrimination. In the behavioral task, Tone2-Tone1 (rising-level) and Tone2-Tone4 (rising-falling) were the most difficult tone pairs, while Tone1-Tone2 and Tone4-Tone2 were the easiest tone pairs, even though they involved the same tone contrasts respectively. In the ERP task, the native English listeners had good discrimination when Tone2 and Tone4 were embedded in strings of Tone1, while poor discrimination when Tone1 was inserted in the context of Tone2 or Tone4. These asymmetries in tone perception might be attributed to the interference of native intonation system and can be altered by training. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Very young infants can discriminate a wide range of native and normative consonants and vowels, and then in a process of perceptual reorganization over the 1st year, discrimination of most normative speech sounds deteriorates. We investigated perceptual reorganization for tones by testing 6- and 9-month-old infants from tone (Chinese) and nontone (English) language environments for speech (lexical tone) and nonspeech (violin sound) tone discrimination in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Overall, Chinese infants performed equally well at 6 and 9 months for both speech and nonspeech tone discrimination. Conversely, English infants' discrimination of lexical tone declined between 6 and 9 months of age, whereas their nonspeech tone discrimination remained constant. These results indicate that the reorganization of tone perception is a function of the native language environment, and that this reorganization is linguistically based.												179	187												2006	10	3					241	265		10.1207/s15327078in1003_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1003_3												2026-01-16	WOS:000242314400003

Using both identification and discrimination tasks, this study compared Chinese speaking musicians and non-musicians in their CF of a lexical tone continuum (from the high level tone, Tonel to the high falling tone, Tone4). While the identification functions showed similar steepness and boundary location between the two subject groups, the discrimination results revealed superior performance in the musicians for discriminating within-category stimuli pairs but not for between-category stimuli. These findings suggest that musical training can enhance sensitivity to subtle pitch differences between within category sounds in the presence of robust mental representations in service of GP of lexical tonal contrasts.												46	50											APR 13	2015	6								436	10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00436	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00436												2026-01-16	WOS:000352816200001

Reduced lexical tone awareness, along with poor word-decoding abilities, is frequently observed in Chinese-speaking children with developmental dyslexia. However, whether this deficit is linked to reduced auditory processing and interrupted structural connectivity in the brain requires further investigation. This study therefore explores the white matter pathways associated with Chinese character recognition and auditory processing of pitch variations, with the objective of to identify the most representative neural correlates for Chinese developmental dyslexia. Methods: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and several behavior measures related to reading attainment and phonological awareness were acquired in twenty-four Chinese-speaking children with developmental dyslexia and twenty-two age-matched controls. We used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectometry to explore the relationships between behavior performance and specific white matter tracts. Results: The results revealed significant correlations of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cerebellar pathways, and thalamopontine tracts with Chinese character recognition (FDR = 0.03235). In addition, the posterior isthmus and anterior splenium of the corpus callosum correlated with auditory processing (FDR = 0.03980). Conclusion: The study provides evidence that the dysconnectivity on white matter pathways correlated with developmental dyslexia in Chinese-speaking children. Furthermore, the impairments of auditory temporal timing processing presented in poor readers with significant phonological deficits are likely to be a result of impoverished myelinization in sub-cortical tracts. Such findings may assist in the clinical identification of Chinese developmental dyslexia. Copyright (C) 2018, Taiwan Pediatric Association.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of high variability phonetic training (HVPT) in improving Mandarin tone perception for native-speaking children with CIs. Method: A total of 28 Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI recipients participated in the study. Half of the children with CIs received a five-session HVPT within a period of 3 weeks. Identification and discrimination of lexical tones produced by familiar talkers (used during training) and novel talkers (not used during training) were measured before, immediately after, and 10 weeks after training termination. The other half untrained children served as control for the identical pre-and posttests. Results: Lexical tone perception significantly improved in both trained identification task and untrained discrimination task for the trainees. There was also a significant effect in transfer of learning to perceiving tones produced by novel talkers. Moreover, training-induced gains were retained for up to 10 weeks after training. By comparison, no significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group. Conclusion: The results provide the first systematical assessment for the efficacy of the HVPT protocol for Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI users with congenital hearing loss, which supports the clinical utility of intensive short-term HVPT in these children's rehabilitative regimens.												9	12											JUN	2021	64	6					2070	2084		10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00631												2026-01-16	WOS:000658757800022

Conversational samples from 20 Taiwanese children who stutter (CWS; M = 4:9; range = 3:2-6:4) were analysed for frequency and type of speech disfluency and lexical tone associated with stuttering-like disfluencies (SLDs). Results indicated that SLDs were significantly more likely to be produced on Mandarin syllables carrying Tone 3 and Tone 4 syllables compared to syllables carrying either Tone 1 or Tone 2. Post-hoc analyses revealed: (1) no significant differences in the stuttering frequencies between Tone 1 and Tone 2, or between Tone 3 and Tone 4, and (2) a higher incidence of stuttering on syllables carrying Tone 3 and Tone 4 embedded in conflicting (as opposed to compatible) tonal contexts. Results suggest that the higher incidence of stuttering on Mandarin syllables carrying either Tone 3 or 4 may be attributed to the increased level of speech motor demand underlying rapid F0 change both within and across syllables.												4	4											FEB	2015	29	2					115	130		10.3109/02699206.2014.966393	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699206.2014.966393												2026-01-16	WOS:000348045700003

Writing System Modulates the Association between Sensitivity to Acoustic Cues in Music and Reading Ability: Evidence from Chinese-English Bilingual Children	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Music and language share many attributes and a large body of evidence shows that sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is positively related to language development and even subsequent reading acquisition. However, such association was mainly found in alphabetic languages. What remains unclear is whether sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is associated with reading in Chinese, a morphosyllabic language. The present study aimed to answer this question by measuring music (i.e., musical metric perception and pitch discrimination), language (i.e., phonological awareness, lexical tone sensitivity), and reading abilities (i.e., word recognition) among 54 third-grade Chinese-English bilingual children. After controlling for age and non-verbal intelligence, we found that both musical metric perception and pitch discrimination accounted for unique variance of Chinese phonological awareness while pitch discrimination rather than musical metric perception predicted Chinese lexical tone sensitivity. More importantly, neither musical metric perception nor pitch discrimination was associated with Chinese reading. As for English, musical metric perception and pitch discrimination were correlated with both English phonological awareness and English reading. Furthermore, sensitivity to acoustic cues in music was associated with English reading through the mediation of English phonological awareness. The current findings indicate that the association between sensitivity to acoustic cues in music and reading may be modulated by writing systems. In Chinese, the mapping between orthography and phonology is not as transparent as in alphabetic languages such as English. Thus, this opaque mapping may alter the auditory perceptual sensitivity in music to Chinese reading.												11	12											NOV 9	2017	8								1965	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01965	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01965												2026-01-16	WOS:000414725700001

Phonetic and Lexical Encoding of Tone in Cantonese Heritage Speakers	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Heritage speakers contend with at least two languages: the less dominant first language (L1), that is, the heritage language, and the more dominant second language (L2). In some cases, their L1 and L2 bear striking phonological differences. In the current study, we investigate Toronto-born Cantonese heritage speakers and their maintenance of Cantonese lexical tone, a linguistic feature that is absent from English, the more dominant L2. Across two experiments, Cantonese heritage speakers were tested on their phonetic/phonological and lexical encoding of tone in Cantonese. Experiment 1 was an AX discrimination task with varying inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), which revealed that heritage speakers discriminated tone pairs with disparate pitch contours better than those with shared pitch contours. Experiment 2 was a medium-term repetition priming experiment, designed to extend the findings of Experiment 1 by examining tone representations at the lexical level. We observed a positive correlation between English dominance and priming in tone minimal pairs that shared contours. Thus, while increased English dominance does not affect heritage speakers' phonological-level representations, tasks that require lexical access suggest that heritage Cantonese speakers may not robustly and fully distinctively encode Cantonese tone in lexical memory.												7	7											SEP	2023	66	3					652	677		10.1177/00238309221122090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00238309221122090												2026-01-16	WOS:001041286900005

In Chinese-Mandarin, lexical tones can be distinguished by the F0 contours. Previous studies found healthy people could use the cue of context to recover the phonological representations of lexical tones from the altered tonal patterns to comprehend the sentences in quiet condition, but can not in noise environment. Lots of research showed that patients with schizophrenia have deficits of speech perception and comprehension. However, it is unclear how context and F0 contours influence speech perception and comprehension in patients with schizophrenia. This study detected the contribution of context and lexical tone to sentence comprehension in four types of sentences by manipulating the context and F0 contours in 32 patients with schizophrenia and 33 healthy controls. The results showed that (1) in patients with schizophrenia, the interaction between context and F0 contour was not significant, which was significant in healthy controls; (2) the scores of sentences with two types of sentences with flattened F0 contours were negatively correlated with hallucination trait scores; (3) the patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower scores on the intelligibility of sentences in all conditions, which were negatively correlated with PANSS-P. The patients with schizophrenia couldn't use the cue of context to recover the phonological representations of lexical tones from the altered tonal patterns when they comprehend the sentences, inner noise may be the underlying mechanism for the deficits of speech perception and comprehension.												0	1											FEB	2018	97						16	21		10.1016/j.jpsychires.2017.10.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2017.10.020												2026-01-16	WOS:000423646600003
J	Gussenhoven, C; van de Ven, M				Gussenhoven, Carlos; van de Ven, Marco			Categorical perception of lexical tone contrasts and gradient perception of the statement-question intonation contrast in Zhumadian Mandarin	LANGUAGE AND COGNITION				Article								We intended to establish if two lexical tone contrasts in Zhumadian Mandarin, one between early and late aligned falls and another between early and late aligned rises, are perceived categorically, while the difference between declarative and interrogative pronunciations of these four tones is perceived gradiently. Presenting stimuli from 7-point acoustic continua between tones and between intonations, we used an identification task and a discrimination task with an experimental group of native listeners and a control group of Indonesian listeners, whose language employs none of the differences within either the falling or the rising pitch contours in its phonology. Only the lexical condition as perceived by the experimental group yielded sigmoid identification functions and a heightened discriminatory sensitivity around the midpoint of continua. The intonational condition in the native group and both conditions in the control group yielded gradient identification functions and smaller, reverse effects of the continuum midpoints in the discrimination task. The results are interpreted to mean that sentence modality contrasts can be expressed gradiently, but that lexical tone differences are represented phonologically, and hence are perceived categorically, despite low phonetic salience of the contrast. This conclusion challenges assumptions about the relation between linguistic functions and linguistic structures.												7	8											DEC	2020	12	4					614	648		10.1017/langcog.2020.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2020.14												2026-01-16	WOS:000589092300002
J	Cheng, YY; Lee, CY				Cheng, Ying-Ying; Lee, Chia-Ying			The Development of Mismatch Responses to Mandarin Lexical Tone in 12-to 24-Month-Old Infants	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This study explores the development of mismatch responses (MMRs) to Mandarin lexical tone changes in infants at 12, 18, and 24 months of age using the multi-deviant oddball paradigm with the low dipping Tone 3 (T3) as the standard, the high level Tone 1 (T1) as the large, and the high rising Tone 2 (T2) as the small deviant. The results show that the large acoustic change between T1/T3 elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) in all three age groups. The small acoustic change between T2/T3 elicited a positive mismatch response (P-MMR) at 12 and 18 months of age, but no MMR was found to the T2/T3 change at 24 months. The coexistence of MMN and P-MMR in the same age group implies that different mechanisms were used for discriminating large and small deviants. Infants were able to detect the T1/T3 change automatically and showed adult-like MMN as early as 6 months of age. However, the detection of the T2/T3 change remains effortful in infants under 24 months of age. These findings support the notion that MMN and P-MMR may be used to index the maturation of speech perception.												29	30											APR 10	2018	9								448	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00448	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00448												2026-01-16	WOS:000429607500001
J	Tao, R; Zhang, KL; Peng, G				Tao, Ran; Zhang, Kaile; Peng, Gang			Music Does Not Facilitate Lexical Tone Normalization: A Speech-Specific Perceptual Process	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Listeners utilize the immediate contexts to efficiently normalize variable vocal streams into standard phonology units. However, researchers debated whether non-speech contexts can also serve as valid clues for speech normalization. Supporters of the two sides proposed a general-auditory hypothesis and a speech-specific hypothesis to explain the underlying mechanisms. A possible confounding factor of this inconsistency is the listeners' perceptual familiarity of the contexts, as the non-speech contexts were perceptually unfamiliar to listeners. In this study, we examined this confounding factor by recruiting a group of native Cantonese speakers with sufficient musical training experience and a control group with minimal musical training. Participants performed lexical tone judgment tasks in three contextual conditions, i.e., speech, non-speech, and music context conditions. Both groups were familiar with the speech context and not familiar with the non-speech context. The musician group was more familiar with the music context than the non-musician group. The results evidenced the lexical tone normalization process in speech context but not non-speech nor music contexts. More importantly, musicians did not outperform non-musicians on any contextual conditions even if the musicians were experienced at pitch perception, indicating that there is no noticeable transfer in pitch perception from the music domain to the linguistic domain for tonal language speakers. The findings showed that even high familiarity with a non-linguistic context cannot elicit an effective lexical tone normalization process, supporting the speech-specific basis of the perceptual normalization process.												6	6											OCT 22	2021	12								717110	10.3389/fpsyg.2021.717110	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.717110												2026-01-16	WOS:000717739900001
J	Wiener, S; Ito, K				Wiener, Seth; Ito, Kiwako			Impoverished acoustic input triggers probability-based tone processing in mono-dialectal Mandarin listeners	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Previous research on Mandarin spoken word recognition suggests that when processing lexical tone native listeners tune to various acoustic properties of the incoming signal such as f0 height, contour and change. These studies overlook the uneven distribution of tone across the Mandarin lexicon; given a particular string of segments, native listeners may be more likely to anticipate a certain tone due to prior experience with the language. The present study used the gating paradigm to investigate how much of the acoustic signal is needed for listeners to trigger such probability-based tone processing. Duration-blocked gates were generated from twelve low frequency and twelve high frequency mono-syllabic morphemes, with each syllable carrying either the most or least probable tone based on spoken corpora. Results from 22 mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers indicate that listeners immediately begin making use of tonal probability information after hearing only the onset and 40 ms of the vowel, primarily when hearing infrequent syllables. These findings demonstrate that the processing of suprasegmental information can be initiated with previously learned distributional knowledge until sufficient acoustic cues inform the listener of an incoming word.

F0 provides an enhanced temporal pitch cue by amplitude modulating the multichannel electrical stimulation pattern at the fundamental frequency (F0) of the incoming speech signal. Word and sentence recognition tests were carried out in quiet and in noise. The responses for the word-recognition test were further segmented into phoneme and tone scores. Off-line implementations of ACE and F0mod were used, and electrical stimulation patterns were directly streamed to the CI subject's implant. To focus on the feasibility of enhanced temporal cues for tonal language perception, idealized PO information that was extracted from speech tokens in quiet was used in the F0mod processing of speech-in-noise mixtures. The results indicated significantly better lexical tone perception with the F0mod strategy than with ACE for the male voice (p < 0.05). No significant differences in sentence recognition were found between F0mod and ACE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

H.; Zheng, Yiqing; Meng, Qinglin			Cochlear-implant Mandarin tone recognition with a disyllabic word corpus	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Despite pitch being considered the primary cue for discriminating lexical tones, there are secondary cues such as loudness contour and duration, which may allow some cochlear implant (CI) tone discrimination even with severely degraded pitch cues. To isolate pitch cues from other cues, we developed a new disyllabic word stimulus set (Di) whose primary (pitch) and secondary (loudness) cue varied independently. This Di set consists of 270 disyllabic words, each having a distinct meaning depending on the perceived tone. Thus, listeners who hear the primary pitch cue clearly may hear a different meaning from listeners who struggle with the pitch cue and must rely on the secondary loudness contour. A lexical tone recognition experiment was conducted, which compared Di with a monosyllabic set of natural recordings. Seventeen CI users and eight normal-hearing (NH) listeners took part in the experiment. Results showed that CI users had poorer pitch cues encoding and their tone recognition performance was significantly influenced by the "missing " or "confusing " secondary cues with the Di corpus. The pitch-contour-based tone recognition is still far from satisfactory for CI users compared to NH listeners, even if some appear to integrate multiple cues to achieve high scores. This disyllabic corpus could be used to examine the performance of pitch recognition of CI users and the effectiveness of pitch cue enhancement based Mandarin tone enhancement strategies. The Di corpus is freely available online: .												4	4											OCT 17	2022	13								1026116	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1026116	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1026116												2026-01-16	WOS:000878100400001

Effects of Age and Bilingualism on Sensitivity to Native and Nonnative Tone Variation: Evidence From Spoken Word Recognition in Mandarin Chinese Learners	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Most children learn a language such as Mandarin Chinese that uses lexical tone to communicate meaning. This study aimed to examine the phonological specificity of tone representations in monolingual and bilingual learners of Mandarin. Two age-groups were tested: toddlers (2.5 to 3.5 years) and preschoolers (4 to 5 years; N = 80). Using a preferential looking paradigm, children were presented with correct and mispronounced (Cantonese or Mandarin tone substitutions) forms of familiar words. In the aggregate, participants demonstrated preferential fixation to visual targets (naming effects) for correctly pronounced words, words mispronounced with native (Mandarin) tone substitutions, and for words mispronounced with nonnative (Cantonese) tone substitutions. However, naming effects were greater for correct pronunciations and for Cantonese tone mispronunciations relative to Mandarin tone mispronunciations. There were no interactions of responses to each trial type with age or with language exposure. Results are discussed in terms of possible determinants of tone sensitivity in early childhood.												1	1											SEP	2020	56	9					1642	1656		10.1037/dev0001041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001041												2026-01-16	WOS:000566725900003
J	Shuai, L; Malins, JG				Shuai, Lan; Malins, Jeffrey G.			Encoding lexical tones in jTRACE: a simulation of monosyllabic spoken word recognition in Mandarin Chinese	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS				Article								Despite its prevalence as one of the most highly influential models of spoken word recognition, the TRACE model has yet to be extended to consider tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese. A key reason for this is that the model in its current state does not encode lexical tone. In this report, we present a modified version of the jTRACE model in which we borrowed on its existing architecture to code for Mandarin phonemes and tones. Units are coded in a way that is meant to capture the similarity in timing of access to vowel and tone information that has been observed in previous studies of Mandarin spoken word recognition. We validated the model by first simulating a recent experiment that had used the visual world paradigm to investigate how native Mandarin speakers process monosyllabic Mandarin words (Malins & Joanisse, 2010). We then subsequently simulated two psycholinguistic phenomena: (1) differences in the timing of resolution of tonal contrast pairs, and (2) the interaction between syllable frequency and tonal probability. In all cases, the model gave rise to results comparable to those of published data with human subjects, suggesting that it is a viable working model of spoken word recognition in Mandarin. It is our hope that this tool will be of use to practitioners studying the psycholinguistics of Mandarin Chinese and will help inspire similar models for other tonal languages, such as Cantonese and Thai.												27	29											FEB	2017	49	1					230	241		10.3758/s13428-015-0690-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0690-0												2026-01-16	WOS:000397198300016

In tone monitoring (Experiment 1) and same-different tone judgement (Experiment 2)-that is, tasks that require an explicit analysis of tone information-an orthographic congruency effect was observed: Better performance was found when both tone and tone marker led to the same response than when they led to opposite, competing responses. In rhyme judgement (Experiment 3), a metaphonological task that allows tone to be processed in a more natural way since it does not require explicit analysis of tone, the orthographic effect emerged only when the interstimulus interval was lengthened from 30 to 1,200 ms. In addition to demonstrating the generalization of the orthographic congruency effect to the suprasegmental domain in Thai, the present data also suggest relatively late and task-dependent activation of orthographic representations of tone.												15	16											OCT	2008	61	10					1515	1537		10.1080/17470210701587305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470210701587305												2026-01-16	WOS:000260170600006

Here, we explore perceptual and experiential factors that drive associative learning of labels that differ in pitch contour. Contrary to the salience hypothesis proposed in Experiment 1, English-learning 14-month-olds failed to map acoustically distinctive level and dipping labels to novel referents, even though they discriminated the labels when no potential referents were present. Conversely, infants readily mapped the less distinctive rising and dipping labels. In Experiment 2, we found that the degree of pitch variation in labels also does not account for learning. Instead, English-learning infants only learned if one of the labels had a rising pitch contour. We argue that experience with hearing and/or producing native language prosody may lead infants to initially over-interpret the role rising pitch plays in differentiating words. Together, our findings suggest that multiple factors contribute to whether specific acoustic forms will function as candidate object labels.												7	8											APR	2019	105						131	140		10.1016/j.jml.2018.12.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2018.12.004												2026-01-16	WOS:000459523200009

A deficit in music pitch processing as manifested in the condition of congenital amusia has been related to difficulties in lexical tone processing for both tone and non-tonal languages. However, it is still unclear whether amusia also affects the perception of vowel phonemes in quiet and in noise. In this study, we examined vowel-plustone identification in quiet and noise conditions among Mandarin-speaking amusics with and without speech tone difficulties (tone agnosics and pure amusics, respectively), and IQ- and age-matched controls. Overall, pure amusics showed vowel and tone identification comparable to the controls in both quiet and noise conditions. Compared to pure amusics and controls, tone agnosics showed deficits in tone perception in both quiet and noise conditions. More importantly, their vowel perception was lower than pure amusics and controls in noise conditions, e.g., at a signal-to-noise ratio of -4 dB, although they showed normal-like performance in quiet and at a signal-to-noise ratio of -8 dB. These results suggest that when amusia affected speech tone processing (e.g., tone agnosics), it could also compromise vowel processing in noise. However, amusia alone does not affect tone or vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese either in quiet or in noise. Overall, the current study highlights the necessity of taking heterogeneity within the amusic group into account when considering the related speech deficits in this group. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yu, YH; Shafer, VL; Sussman, ES				Yu, Yan H.; Shafer, Valerie L.; Sussman, Elyse S.			The Duration of Auditory Sensory Memory for Vowel Processing: Neurophysiological and Behavioral Measures	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Speech perception behavioral research suggests that rates of sensory memory decay are dependent on stimulus properties at more than one level (e.g., acoustic level, phonemic level). The neurophysiology of sensory memory decay rate has rarely been examined in the context of speech processing. In a lexical tone study, we showed that long-term memory representation of lexical tone slows the decay rate of sensory memory for these tones. Here, we tested the hypothesis that long-term memory representation of vowels slows the rate of auditory sensory memory decay in a similar way to that of lexical tone. Event-related potential (ERP) responses were recorded to Mandarin non-words contrasting the vowels /i/vs. /u/ and /y/vs. /u/ from first-language (L1) Mandarin and L1 American English participants under short and long interstimulus interval (ISI) conditions (short ISI: an average of 575 ms, long ISI: an average of 2675 ms). Results revealed poorer discrimination of the vowel contrasts for English listeners than Mandarin listeners, but with different patterns for behavioral perception and neural discrimination. As predicted, English listeners showed the poorest discrimination and identification for the vowel contrast /y/ vs. /u/, and poorer performance in the long ISI condition. In contrast to Yu et al. (2017), however, we found no effect of ISI reflected in the neural responses, specifically the mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a and late negativity ERP amplitudes. We did see a language group effect, with Mandarin listeners generally showing larger MMN and English listeners showing larger P3a. The behavioral results revealed that native language experience plays a role in echoic sensory memory trace maintenance, but the failure to find an effect of ISI on the ERP results suggests that vowel and lexical tone memory traces decay at different rates. Highlights: We examined the interaction between auditory sensory memory decay and language experience. We compared MMN, P3a, LN and behavioral responses in short vs. long interstimulus intervals. We found that different from lexical tone contrast, MMN, P3a, and LN changes to vowel contrasts are not influenced by lengthening the ISI to 2.6 s. We also found that the English listeners discriminated the non-native vowel contrast with lower accuracy under the long ISI condition.												8	9											MAR 22	2018	9								335	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00335	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00335												2026-01-16	WOS:000428075400001
J	Zhang, H; Ma, W; Ding, HW; Zhang, Y				Zhang, Hao; Ma, Wen; Ding, Hongwei; Zhang, Yang			Sustainable Benefits of High Variability Phonetic Training in Mandarin-speaking Kindergarteners With Cochlear Implants: Evidence From Categorical Perception of Lexical Tones	EAR AND HEARING				Article								Objectives:Although pitch reception poses a great challenge for individuals with cochlear implants (CIs), formal auditory training (e.g., high variability phonetic training [HVPT]) has been shown to provide direct benefits in pitch-related perceptual performances such as lexical tone recognition for CI users. As lexical tones in spoken language are expressed with a multitude of distinct spectral, temporal, and intensity cues, it is important to determine the sources of training benefits for CI users. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a rigorous fine-scale evaluation with the categorical perception (CP) paradigm to control the acoustic parameters and test the efficacy and sustainability of HVPT for Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI recipients. The main hypothesis was that HVPT-induced perceptual learning would greatly enhance CI users' ability to extract the primary pitch contours from spoken words for lexical tone identification and discrimination. Furthermore, individual differences in immediate and long-term gains from training would likely be attributable to baseline performance and duration of CI use. Design:Twenty-eight prelingually deaf Mandarin-speaking kindergarteners with CIs were tested. Half of them received five sessions of HVPT within a period of 3 weeks. The other half served as control who did not receive the formal training. Two classical CP tasks on a tonal continuum from Mandarin tone 1 (high-flat in pitch) to tone 2 (mid-rising in pitch) with fixed acoustic features of duration and intensity were administered before (pretest), immediately after (posttest), and 10 weeks posttraining termination (follow-up test). Participants were instructed to either label a speech stimulus along the continuum (i.e., identification task) or determine whether a pair of stimuli separated by zero or two steps from the continuum was the same or different (i.e., discrimination task). Identification function measures (i.e., boundary position and boundary width) and discrimination function scores (i.e., between-category score, within-category score, and peakedness score) were assessed for each child participant across the three test sessions. Results:Linear mixed-effects (LME) models showed significant training-induced enhancement in lexical tone categorization with significantly narrower boundary width and better between-category discrimination in the immediate posttest over pretest for the trainees. Furthermore, training-induced gains were reliably retained in the follow-up test 10 weeks after training. By contrast, no significant changes were found in the control group across sessions. Regression analysis confirmed that baseline performance (i.e., boundary width in the pretest session) and duration of CI use were significant predictors for the magnitude of training-induced benefits. Conclusions:The stringent CP tests with synthesized stimuli that excluded acoustic cues other than the pitch contour and were never used in training showed strong evidence for the efficacy of HVPT in yielding immediate and sustained improvement in lexical tone categorization for Mandarin-speaking children with CIs. The training results and individual differences have remarkable implications for developing personalized computer-based short-term HVPT protocols that may have sustainable long-term benefits for aural rehabilitation in this clinical population.												7	8											SEP-OCT	2023	44	5					990	1006		10.1097/AUD.0000000000001341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000001341												2026-01-16	WOS:001051835700007
J	Chen, F; Peng, G				Chen, Fei; Peng, Gang			Reduced Sensitivity to Between-Category Information but Preserved Categorical Perception of Lexical Tones in Tone Language Speakers With Congenital Amusia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Previous studies have shown that for congenital amusics, long-term tone language experience cannot compensate for lexical tone processing difficulties. However, it is still unknown whether such difficulties are merely caused by domain-transferred insensitivity in lower-level acoustic processing and/or by higher-level phonological processing of linguistic pitch as well. The current P300 study links and extends previous studies by uncovering the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning lexical tone perception difficulties in Mandarin-speaking amusics. Both the behavioral index (d ') and P300 amplitude showed reduced within-category as well as between-category sensitivity among the Mandarin-speaking amusics regardless of the linguistic status of the signal. The results suggest that acoustic pitch processing difficulties in amusics are manifested profoundly and further persist into the higher-level phonological processing that involves the neural processing of different lexical tone categories. Our findings indicate that long-term tone language experience may not compensate for the reduced acoustic pitch processing in tone language speakers with amusia but rather may extend to the neural processing of the phonological information of lexical tones during the attentive stage. However, from both the behavioral and neural evidence, the peakedness scores of thed ' and P300 amplitude were comparable between amusics and controls. It seems that the basic categorical perception (CP) pattern of native lexical tones is preserved in Mandarin-speaking amusics, indicating that they may have normal or near normal long-term categorical memory.												9	9											SEP 30	2020	11								581410	10.3389/fpsyg.2020.581410	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.581410												2026-01-16	WOS:000578790900001
J	Liu, LQ; Kager, R				Liu, Liquan; Kager, Rene			Perception of tones by bilingual infants learning non-tone languages	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION				Article								This paper examines the ability of bilingual infants who were learning Dutch and another non-tone language to discriminate tonal contrasts. All infants from 5 to 18 months of age succeeded in discriminating a tonal contrast of Mandarin Chinese (Tone 1 versus Tone 4) and showed a U-shaped pattern when facing a less acoustically salient manipulated version (contracted) of the aforementioned contrast. Specifically, infants showed initial sensitivity to the contracted contrast during their early months, followed by a loss of sensitivity at the stage where tonal perceptual reorganization typically occurs, and a sensitivity rebound by the end of the first year after birth. Compared to a previous studying of ours testing monolingual Dutch infants (Liu & Kager, 2014), the discrimination patterns of bilingual infants revealed both similarities and differences. On one hand, as with monolinguals, non-tone-learning bilingual infants' tonal perception presented plasticity influenced by contrast acoustic salience along the trajectory of perceptual reorganization; as well as a general U-shaped perceptual pattern when discriminating non-native tones. On the other hand, bilingual infants appeared to regain sensitivity to the contracted tonal contrast at an earlier age (11-12 months) in comparison with monolinguals infants (17-18 months). We provide several explanations, stemming from the simultaneous exposure to two languages, to account for the 6-month bilingual perceptual plasticity from linguistic and cognitive perspectives. The overall outcomes of the study offer insights into the infant perceptual reorganization and language development trajectory, expand on the differences between monolingual and bilingual language development, and broaden our understanding of the influence of bilingual exposure to the perception of non-native contrasts in infancy from linguistic and cognitive perspectives.												40	41											MAY	2017	20	3					561	575		10.1017/S1366728916000183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728916000183												2026-01-16	WOS:000399401100008
J	Shaw, JA; Tyler, MD				Shaw, Jason A.; Tyler, Michael D.			Effects of vowel coproduction on the timecourse of tone recognition	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Vowel contrasts tend to be perceived independently of pitch modulation, but it is not known whether pitch can be perceived independently of vowel quality. This issue was investigated in the context of a lexical tone language, Mandarin Chinese, using a printed word version of the visual world paradigm. Eye movements to four printed words were tracked while listeners heard target words that differed from competitors only in tone (test condition) or also in onset consonant and vowel (control condition). Results showed that the timecourse of tone recognition is influenced by vowel quality for high, low, and rising tones. For these tones, the time for the eyes to converge on the target word in the test condition (relative to control) depended on the vowel with which the tone was coarticulated with /a/ and /i/ supporting faster recognition of high, low, and rising tones than /u/. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that tone-conditioned variation in the articulation of /a/ and /i/ facilitates rapid recognition of tones. The one exception to this general pattern-no effect of vowel quality on falling tone perception-may be due to fortuitous amplification of the harmonics relevant for pitch perception in this context.												9	9											APR	2020	147	4					2511	2524		10.1121/10.0001103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0001103												2026-01-16	WOS:000530274700002

Twenty preschoolers, 18 school-aged children, and 26 adults participated in this study. Two sets of synthesized speech stimuli varying in Mandarin consonant (alveolo-palatal affricate vs. fricative) and lexical tone features (rising vs. contour tone) were used to examine the developmental course of speech perception abilities. The results indicated that only the adult group demonstrated typical early mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, suggesting that the ability to discriminate specific speech cues in Mandarin consonant and lexical tone is a continuing process in preschool-and school-aged children. Additionally, distinct MMR patterns provided evidence indicating diverse developmental courses to different speech characteristics. By incorporating data from the two speech conditions, we propose using MMR profiles consisting of mismatch negativity (MMN), positive mismatch response (p-MMR), and late discriminative negativity (LDN) as possible brain indices to investigate speech perception development.												32	36											APR 22	2014	9	4							e95587	10.1371/journal.pone.0095587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095587												2026-01-16	WOS:000335240300057

This study aims at better clarifying the involvement of different linguistic subdomains in this cross-domain link, assessing whether or not musicality and music expertise enhance phonological and lexical tone processing of Mandarin Chinese. In two experiments different groups of adults and children with no previous experience in tonal languages, were invited to perform a same-different task trying to detect phonological and tonal variations in pairs of sequences of monosyllabic Mandarin Chinese words. Main results show that all subjects perform significantly better in detecting phonological variations rather than tonal ones. They also show that both melodic proficiency and music expertise are good predictors for a better tonal, but not phonological identification. Data lead to a model of music-to-language transfer effect in which musicality selectively affects linguistic intonation while leaving phonological processing substantially unaffected.												82	94												2010	22	1					46	61		10.1080/09541440802708136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09541440802708136												2026-01-16	WOS:000274915800004
J	Showalter, CE; Hayes-Harb, R				Showalter, Catherine E.; Hayes-Harb, Rachel			Unfamiliar orthographic information and second language word learning: A novel lexicon study	SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH				Article								Recent research indicates that knowledge of words' spellings can influence knowledge of the phonological forms of second language (L2) words when the first and second languages use the same orthographic symbols. It is yet unknown whether learners can make similar use of unfamiliar orthographic symbols. In this study we investigate whether native English speakers use orthographic tone marks to help them associate lexical tone with new L2 words? Native English speakers with no knowledge of Mandarin were assigned to 'Tone Marks' or 'No Tone Marks' word learning groups. During a word learning phase, they learned to associate Mandarin nonwords varying in lexical tone with orthographic forms (written in pinyin with/without tone marks) and pictured 'meanings'. In Experiment 1, participants were asked whether a picture associated with, for example, tone 1 matched an auditory form containing tone 2. Tone Marks participants outperformed No Tone Marks participants, suggesting that the availability of unfamiliar orthographic symbols helped them associate lexical tone with the new words. In Experiment 2, the test involved matching an orthographic representation and an auditory word. Tone Marks participants performed above chance, while No Tone Marks participants did not, indicating that Tone Marks participants learned the correspondences between auditory tones and tone marks to some extent. We conclude that the presence of a novel orthographic feature (in this case, tone marks) can support native English speakers' ability to associate a novel phonological feature (in this case, lexical tone) with newly-learned lexical items.												59	82											APR	2013	29	2					185	200		10.1177/0267658313480154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0267658313480154												2026-01-16	WOS:000317939500004
J	Shao, J; Bakhtiar, M; Zhang, CC				Shao, Jing; Bakhtiar, Mehdi; Zhang, Caicai			Research Article Impaired Categorical Perception of Speech Sounds Under the Backward Masking Condition in Adults Who Stutter	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Evidence increasingly indicates that people with developmental stuttering have auditory perception deficits. Our previous research has indicated similar but slower performance in categorical perception of the speech sounds under the quiet condition in children who stutter and adults who stutter (AWS) compared with their typically fluent counterparts. We hypothesized that the quiet condition may not be sufficiently sensitive to reveal subtle perceptual deficiencies in people who stutter. This study examined this hypothesis by testing the categorical perception of speech and nonspeech sounds under backward masking condition (i.e., a noise was presented immediately after the target stimuli). Method: Fifteen Cantonese-speaking AWS and 15 adults who do not stutter (AWNS) were tested on the categorical perception of four stimulus continua, namely, consonant varying in voice onset time (VOT), vowel, lexical tone, and nonspeech, under the backward masking condition using identification and discrimination tasks. Results: AWS demonstrated a broader boundary width than AWNS in the identification task. AWS also exhibited a worse performance than AWNS in the discrimination of between-category stimuli but a comparable performance in the discrimination of within-category stimuli, indicating reduced sensitivity to sounds that belonged to different phonemic categories among AWS. Moreover, AWS showed similar patterns of impaired categorical perception across the four stimulus types, although the boundary location on the VOT continuum occurred at an earlier point in AWS than in AWNS. Conclusions: The findings provide robust evidence that AWS exhibit impaired categorical perception of speech and nonspeech sounds under the backward masking condition. Temporal processing (i.e., VOT manipulation), frequency/ spectral/formant processing (i.e., lexical tone or vowel manipulations), and nonlinguistic pitch processing were all found to be impaired in AWS. Altogether, the findings support the hypothesis that AWS might be less efficient in accessing the phonemic representations when exposed to a demanding listening condition.												8	8											JUL	2022	65	7					2554	2570		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-21-00276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-21-00276												2026-01-16	WOS:000843881300011
J	Si, XP; Zhou, WJ; Hong, B				Si, Xiaopeng; Zhou, Wenjing; Hong, Bo			Cooperative cortical network for categorical processing of Chinese lexical tone	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				Article								In tonal languages such as Chinese, lexical tone with varying pitch contours serves as a key feature to provide contrast in word meaning. Similar to phoneme processing, behavioral studies have suggested that Chinese tone is categorically perceived. However, its underlying neural mechanism remains poorly understood. By conducting cortical surface recordings in surgical patients, we revealed a cooperative cortical network along with its dynamics responsible for this categorical perception. Based on an oddball paradigm, we found amplified neural dissimilarity between cross-category tone pairs, rather than between within-category tone pairs, over cortical sites covering both the ventral and dorsal streams of speech processing. The bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) exhibited increased response latencies and enlarged neural dissimilarity, suggesting a ventral hierarchy that gradually differentiates the acoustic features of lexical tones. In addition, the bilateral motor cortices were also found to be involved in categorical processing, interacting with both the STG and the MTG and exhibiting a response latency in between. Moreover, the motor cortex received enhanced Granger causal influence from the semantic hub, the anterior temporal lobe, in the right hemisphere. These unique data suggest that there exists a distributed cooperative cortical network supporting the categorical processing of lexical tone in tonal language speakers, not only encompassing a bilateral temporal hierarchy that is shared by categorical processing of phonemes but also involving intensive speech-motor interactions over the right hemisphere, which might be the unique machinery responsible for the reliable discrimination of tone identities.												40	42											NOV 14	2017	114	46					12303	12308		10.1073/pnas.1710752114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710752114												2026-01-16	WOS:000415173300073
J	Zhang, CC; Shao, J; Huang, XN				Zhang, Caicai; Shao, Jing; Huang, Xunan			Deficits of congenital amusia beyond pitch: Evidence from impaired categorical perception of vowels in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics	PLOS ONE				Article								Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder of fine-grained pitch processing in music and speech. However, it remains unclear whether amusia is a pitch-specific deficit, or whether it affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly, such as the perception of formant frequency in vowels, apart from pitch. In this study, in order to illuminate the scope of the deficits, we compared the performance of 15 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 15 matched controls on the categorical perception of sound continua in four stimulus contexts: lexical tone, pure tone, vowel, and voice onset time (VOT). Whereas lexical tone, pure tone and vowel continua rely on frequency/spectral processing, the VOT continuum depends on duration/temporal processing. We found that the amusic participants performed similarly to controls in all stimulus contexts in the identification, in terms of the across-category boundary location and boundary width. However, the amusic participants performed systematically worse than controls in discriminating stimuli in those three contexts that depended on frequency/spectral processing (lexical tone, pure tone and vowel), whereas they performed normally when discriminating duration differences (VOT). These findings suggest that the deficit of amusia is probably not pitch specific, but affects frequency/spectral processing more broadly. Furthermore, there appeared to be differences in the impairment of frequency/spectral discrimination in speech and nonspeech contexts. The amusic participants exhibited less benefit in between-category discriminations than controls in speech contexts (lexical tone and vowel), suggesting reduced categorical perception; on the other hand, they performed inferiorly compared to controls across the board regardless of between-and within-category discriminations in nonspeech contexts (pure tone), suggesting impaired general auditory processing. These differences imply that the frequency/spectral-processing deficit might be manifested differentially in speech and nonspeech contexts in amusics D it is manifested as a deficit of higher-level phonological processing in speech sounds, and as a deficit of lower-level auditory processing in nonspeech sounds.												36	36											AUG 22	2017	12	8							e0183151	10.1371/journal.pone.0183151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183151												2026-01-16	WOS:000408085100029
J	Shen, GN; Froud, K				Shen, Guannan; Froud, Karen			Categorical perception of lexical tones by English learners of Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Whether native speakers of non-tonal languages can acquire categorical representations of lexical tones remains controversial. This study investigates the acquisition of lexical tone categories by native English speakers learning Mandarin Chinese as a foreign language by comparing the categorical perception (CP) of lexical tones between three groups of listeners: (1) native English speakers who had taken advanced Mandarin courses in colleges; (2) native English speakers with no knowledge of Mandarin Chinese; and (3) native Mandarin speakers. Two tonal continua derived from natural speech within carrier phrases were created through interpolation within two tonal contrasts (tone 1/tone 4, T1/T4; tone 2/tone 3, T2/T3). Results showed categorical-like perception of tones by native Mandarin speakers. The inexperienced English speakers performed near chance on discrimination tasks and showed significantly broader identification boundaries than the other two groups. The learners of Mandarin showed similar pattern of CP to native Mandarin speakers, but with higher overall discrimination scores. Findings suggest that CP of lexical tone may be available to advanced second language learners.

Methods: 96 participants, aged from 2.41 years to 7.09 years, were recruited in mainland China. The children exhibited normal cognitive abilities and received unilateral implants at an average age of 2.72 years, with ages ranging from 0.69 to 5 years of age. Results: The mean score for tone identification was 77% (SD = 13%; chance level = 50%). Tone 2/tone 3 was the most difficult tone contrast to identify. Children with a longer duration of CI use and whose mothers had more years of education tended to perform better in sentence perception in quiet and in noise. Having undergone a hearing aid trial before implantation and more residual hearing were additional factors contributing to better sentence perception in noise. The only demographical variable that related to tone perception in quiet was duration of CI. In addition, while there was a modest correlation between tone perception and sentence perception in quiet (r(s) = 0.47, p < 0.001), the correlation between tone perception in quiet and sentence perception in noise was much weaker (r(s) = 0.28, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings suggested that most young children who had been implanted before 5 years of age and had 1-3 years of implant use did not catch up with their aged peers with normal hearing in tone perception and sentence perception. The weak to moderate correlation between tone perception in quiet and sentence perception might imply that the improvement of tone perception in quiet may not necessarily contribute to sentence perception, especially in noise condition.

J	Winskel, H				Winskel, Heather			Script relativity hypothesis: evidence from reading with different spatial layouts and varied lexical tone	READING AND WRITING				Article								A contemporary question is whether the script we read in affects our cognition, termed the script relativity hypothesis (Pae in: Script effects as the hidden drive of the mind, cognition, and culture, Springer, Berlin, 2020). The aim of this review is to examine variation in spatial layout (interword spaces and linear-nonlinear configuration) and representation of lexical tone across scripts and whether disparities in those features affect cognition. Both script features are strong candidates for potentially producing script relativity effects. Readers of densely crowded nonlinear scripts (e.g., Thai, Sinhala) may have heightened visuo-perceptual abilities in comparison to readers of linear scripts (e.g., Roman script). Tonal languages vary in terms of both their relative complexity and whether they orthographically encode this feature in their script. This variation may produce differences in sensitivity to tone perception and auditory perceptual skills in readers of tonal languages that do and do not orthographically represent tone in the script and in contrast to readers of non-tonal languages. The empirical research reviewed tends to support a weaker version of the script relativity hypothesis, where there is a channeling effect on attention due to script-specific features while actually reading. The question is still open to debate as to whether this attention allocation translates into more profound, nonlinguistic cognitive consequences. Notably, the research reviewed was not specifically designed to investigate the script relativity hypothesis. In order to investigate longer-term cognitive consequences of this script variation, carefully designed studies need to be conducted with this overriding goal in mind. Future research needs to include other lesser studied languages and their scripts so that we can ascertain what are common cognitive patterns or processes and what are shaped by variation in script-specific features.												4	4											JUN	2022	35	6			SI		1323	1341		10.1007/s11145-021-10225-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11145-021-10225-7		JAN 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000740591500001

Tone language learning infants (Experiment 1, Mandarin monolingual; Experiment 2, Mandarin-English bilingual) were tested with Mandarin (native) or Thai (non-native) lexical tone pairs which contrasted static vs. dynamic (high vs. rising) tones or dynamic vs. dynamic (rising vs. falling) tones. Non-tone language, English-learning infants (Experiment 3) were tested on English intonational contrasts or the Mandarin or Thai tone contrasts. Monolingual Mandarin language infants were able to bind tones to novel words for the Mandarin High-Rising contrast, but not for the Mandarin Rising-Falling contrast; and they were insensitive to both the High-Rising and the Rising-Falling tone contrasts in Thai. Bilingual English-Mandarin infants were similar to the Mandarin monolinguals in that they were sensitive to the Mandarin High-Rising contrast and not to the Mandarin Rising-Falling contrast. However, unlike the Mandarin monolinguals, they were also sensitive to the High Rising contrast in Thai. Monolingual English learning infants were insensitive to all three types of contrasts (Mandarin, Thai, English), although they did respond differentially to tone-bearing vs. intonation-marked words. Findings suggest that infants' sensitivity to tones in word learning contexts depends heavily on tone properties, and that this influence is, in some cases, stronger than effects of language familiarity. Moreover, bilingual infants demonstrated greater phonological flexibility in tone interpretation.												24	25											JAN 4	2018	8								2190	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02190	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02190												2026-01-16	WOS:000419399000002

However, compared with monolingual language acquisition, relatively little is known about how bilingual children acquire native phonology. Moreover, much less is known about how children acquire knowledge of tone languages in comparison with consonant-vowel languages such as English. In this study, 6-year-old Mandarin monolingual and English-Mandarin bilingual learners were tested on their sensitivity to vowel, consonant, and lexical tone mispronunciations of known words in a preferential looking task (N = 48; Experiment 1) and in an explicit judgment task (N = 48; Experiment 2). Results demonstrated that in Experiment 1 both monolingual and bilingual participants were sensitive to vowel mispronunciations. Bilingual children were also sensitive to consonant and tone mispronunciations. When sensitivity to mispronunciations was compared with correct pronunciations, monolingual and bilingual participants were similarly sensitive to consonant mispronunciations and similarly insensitive to tones, but they demonstrated subtle variance in vowel sensitivity. In Experiment 2, both groups demonstrated reduced sensitivity to tone mispronunciations relative to vowel and consonant mispronunciations. Therefore, in both implicit and explicit tasks, participants demonstrated asymmetrical sensitivity to segments (vowels and consonants) and tones. Our findings are discussed in terms of influences of phonological variation and language background on children's word knowledge. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our study examined the influence of implantation age on the recognition of consonants, lexical tones and sentences respectively, and more importantly, the contribution of phonological skills to sentence repetition accuracy in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs. Methods: The participants were three groups of prelingually deaf children who received cochlear implants at various ages and their age-matched controls with normal hearing. Three tasks were administered to assess their consonant perception, lexical tone recognition and language skills in open-set sentence repetition. Results: Children with CIs lagged behind NH peers in all the three tests, and performances on segmental, suprasegmental and sentence-level processing were differentially modulated by implantation age. Furthermore, performances on recognition of consonants and lexical tones were significant predictors of sentence repetition accuracy in the children with CIs. Conclusion: Overall, segmental and suprasegmental perception as well as sentence-level processing is impaired in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs compared with age-matched children with NH. In children with CIs recognition of segmental and suprasegmental phonemes at the lower level predicts sentence repetition accuracy at the higher level. More importantly, implantation age plays an important role in the development of phonological skills and higher-order language skills, suggesting that age-appropriate aural rehabilitation and speech intervention programs need to be developed in order to better help CI users who receive CIs at different ages.												11	11											OCT	2019	93								103453	10.1016/j.ridd.2019.103453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2019.103453												2026-01-16	WOS:000486136900004
J	Ma, JKY; Ciocca, V; Whitehill, TL				Ma, Joan K-Y; Ciocca, Valter; Whitehill, Tara L.			The perception of intonation questions and statements in Cantonese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								In tone languages there are potential conflicts in the perception of lexical tone and intonation, as both depend mainly on the differences in fundamental frequency (F0) patterns. The present study investigated the acoustic cues associated with the perception of sentences as questions or statements in Cantonese, as a function of the lexical tone in sentence final position. Cantonese listeners performed intonation identification tasks involving complete sentences, isolated final syllables, and sentences without the final syllable (carriers). Sensitivity (d' scores) were similar for complete sentences and final syllables but were significantly lower for carriers. Sensitivity was also affected by tone identity. These findings show that the perception of questions and statements relies primarily on the F0 characteristics of the final syllables (local F0 cues). A measure of response bias (c) provided evidence for a general bias toward the perception of statements. Logistic regression analyses showed that utterances were accurately classified as questions or statements by using average F0 and F0 interval. Average F0 of carriers (global F0 cue) was also found to be a reliable secondary cue. These findings suggest that the use of F0 cues for the perception of intonation question in tonal languages is likely to be language-specific. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

Spoken word recognition in early childhood: Comparative effects of vowel, consonant and lexical tone variation	COGNITION				Article								The majority of the world's languages exploit consonants, vowels and lexical tones to contrast the meanings of individual words. However, the majority of experimental research on early language development focuses on consonant-vowel languages. In the present study, the role of consonants, vowels and lexical tones in emergent word knowledge are directly compared in toddlers (2.5-3.5 years) and preschoolers (4-5 years) who were bilingual native learners of a consonant-vowel-tone language (Mandarin Chinese). Using a preferential looking paradigm, participants were presented with correct pronunciations and consonantal, vowel, and tonal variations of known words. Responses to each type of variation were assessed via gaze fixations to a visual target. When their labels were correctly pronounced, visual targets were reliably identified at both age groups. However, in toddlers, there was a high degree of sensitivity to mispronunciations due to variation in lexical tones relative to those due to consonants and vowels. This pattern was reversed in preschoolers, who were more sensitive to consonant and vowel variation than to tone variation.

The current study used fine-scale synthetic speech stimuli to investigate the bimodal benefit for lexical tone categorization in Mandarin-speaking kindergarteners using a CI and an HA in opposite ears. Method: The data were collected from 16 participants who were required to complete two classical tasks for speech categorical perception (CP) with CI + HA device condition and CI alone condition. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to evaluate the identification and discrimination scores across different device conditions. Results: The bimodal kindergarteners showed CP for the continuum varying from Mandarin Tone 1 and Tone 2. Moreover, the additional acoustic information from the contralateral HA contributes to improved lexical tone categorization, with a steeper slope, a higher discrimination score of between-category stimuli pair, and an improved peakedness score (i.e., an increased benefit magnitude for discriminations of between-category over within-category pairs) for the CI + HA condition than the CI alone condition. The bimodal kindergarteners with better residual hearing thresholds at 250 Hz level in the nonimplanted ear could perceive lexical tones more categorically. Conclusion: The enhanced CP results with bimodal listening provide clear evidence for the clinical practice to fit a contralateral HA in the nonimplanted ear in kindergarteners with unilateral CIs with direct benefits from the low-frequency acoustic hearing.												11	11											DEC	2020	63	12					4238	4251		10.1044/2020_JSLHR-20-00224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2020_JSLHR-20-00224												2026-01-16	WOS:000602629500024
J	Son, G				Son, Gayeon			Korean-speaking children's perceptual development in multidimensional acoustic space	JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE				Article								This study investigated how Korean toddlers' perception of stop categories develops in the acoustic dimensions of VOT and F0. To examine the developmental trajectory of VOT and F0 in toddlers' perceptual space, a perceptual identification test with natural and synthesized sound stimuli was conducted with 58 Korean monolingual children (aged 2-4 years). The results revealed that toddlers' perceptual mapping functions on VOT mainly in the high-pitch environment, resulting in more successful perceptual accuracy in fortis or aspirated stops than in lenis stops. F0 development is correlated with the perceptual distinction of lenis from aspirated stops, but no consistent categorical perception for F0 was found before four years of age. The findings suggest that multi-parametric control in perceptual development guides an acquisition ordering of Korean stop phonemes and that tonal development is significantly related to the acquisition of Korean phonemic contrasts.												2	3											MAY	2020	47	3					579	599	PII S0305000919000692	10.1017/S0305000919000692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305000919000692												2026-01-16	WOS:000524941100004
J	Zhang, YX; Schmidt, E; Post, B				Zhang, Yixin; Schmidt, Elaine; Post, Brechtje			Perception of Intonation on Neutral Tone in Mandarin	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION				Article								In Mandarin, lexical tone has been found to interact with intonational tone to influence intonation perception, with the falling T4 facilitating the perception of the statement/question contrast the most, and the rising T2 the least. However, in addition to the four citation tones T1-T4, Mandarin has "neutral tone" which marks weak, non-initial syllables that do not carry a citation tone. The prevailing view is that neutral tone is, in fact, phonologically toneless. It is unknown whether neutral tone can also affect intonation perception. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that if neutral tone is indeed toneless, it cannot interact with intonational tone in the same way as citation tones do. We investigated this novel hypothesis with a perception experiment in which 22 Mandarin speakers had to determine whether disyllabic citation tone and neutral tone words were a question or statement. Results show that the identification of intonation contours is more accurate for neutral tone than for T2, and similarly accurate for neutral tone and T4, regardless of whether the neutral tone is intrinsic or derived. Furthermore, both T4 and neutral tone are realized with a reduced pitch range at a higher pitch level in questions, unlike T2, which is characterized by a slightly expanded pitch range and a higher pitch level. It is possible that intonation perception in Mandarin is facilitated by changes in the phonetic shapes of lexical tones brought by intonation rather than the phonological interaction between lexical tones and intonation. The importance of pitch changes to the intonation perception in Mandarin was further tested in a second perception experiment with the same 22 participants and disyllabic stimuli with manipulated pitch level and range. Results indicate that the use of pitch cues in intonation perception shows tone-specific differences, namely, pitch range is more important in signaling the question/statement contrast in utterances ending with T4 or neutral tone, while pitch level is the only perceptual cue to interrogativity for utterances ending in T2.												2	2											JUN 27	2022	7								849132	10.3389/fcomm.2022.849132	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2022.849132												2026-01-16	WOS:000822933300001
J	Nan, Y; Sun, YN; Peretz, I				Nan, Yun; Sun, Yanan; Peretz, Isabelle			Congenital amusia in speakers of a tone language: association with lexical tone agnosia	BRAIN				Article								Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder that affects the processing of musical pitch in speakers of non-tonal languages like English and French. We assessed whether this musical disorder exists among speakers of Mandarin Chinese who use pitch to alter the meaning of words. Using the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, we tested 117 healthy young Mandarin speakers with no self-declared musical problems and 22 individuals who reported musical difficulties and scored two standard deviations below the mean obtained by the Mandarin speakers without amusia. These 22 amusic individuals showed a similar pattern of musical impairment as did amusic speakers of non-tonal languages, by exhibiting a more pronounced deficit in melody than in rhythm processing. Furthermore, nearly half the tested amusics had impairments in the discrimination and identification of Mandarin lexical tones. Six showed marked impairments, displaying what could be called lexical tone agnosia, but had normal tone production. Our results show that speakers of tone languages such as Mandarin may experience musical pitch disorder despite early exposure to speech-relevant pitch contrasts. The observed association between the musical disorder and lexical tone difficulty indicates that the pitch disorder as defining congenital amusia is not specific to music or culture but is rather general in nature.												134	152											SEP	2010	133		9				2635	2642		10.1093/brain/awq178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq178												2026-01-16	WOS:000281529000015

Method: The experimental design manipulated two factors, that is, semantic context, by comparing the intelligibility of normal sentence versus word list, and F-0 contours, by comparing the intelligibility of utterances with natural versus flat F-0 patterns. Twenty-two children with CIs completed a speech recognition test. Results: Children with CIs could use both semantic context and F-0 contours to assist speech recognition. Furthermore, natural F-0 patterns provided extra benefit when semantic context was present than when it was absent. Conclusion: Dynamic F-0 contours play an important role in speech recognition by Mandarin-speaking children with CIs despite the well-known limitation of CI devices in extracting F-0 information.												12	13											AUG	2018	61	8					2146	2152		10.1044/2018_JSLHR-H-17-0327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-H-17-0327												2026-01-16	WOS:000444980200020
J	Wong, PCM; Ettlinger, M				Wong, Patrick C. M.; Ettlinger, Marc			Predictors of spoken language learning	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS				Article								We report two sets of experiments showing that the large individual variability in language learning success in adults can be attributed to neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, and perceptual factors. In the first set of experiments, native English-speaking adults learned to incorporate lexically meaningfully pitch patterns in words. We found those who were successful to have higher activation in bilateral auditory cortex, larger volume in Heschl's Gyrus, and more accurate pitch pattern perception. All of these measures were performed before training began. In the second set of experiments, native English-speaking adults learned a phonological grammatical system governing the formation of words of an artificial language. Again, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and cognitive factors predicted to an extent how well these adults learned. Taken together, these experiments suggest that neural and behavioral factors can be used to predict spoken language learning. These predictors can inform the redesign of existing training paradigms to maximize learning for learners with different learning profiles. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (a) understand the linguistic concepts of lexical tone and phonological grammar, (b) identify the brain regions associated with learning lexical tone and phonological grammar, and (c) identify the cognitive predictors for successful learning of a tone language and phonological rules.

N.; Chen, Fei			Pre-attentive fundamental frequency processing in Mandarin-speaking children with cochlear implants as revealed by the peak latency of positive mismatch response	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								IntroductionFundamental frequency (F0) serves as the primary acoustic cue for Mandarin tone perception. Recent behavioral studies suggest that F0 information may be differently processed between Mandarin-speaking normal-hearing (NH) children and children with cochlear implants (CIs), which may partially explain the unsatisfactory outcome of lexical tone recognition using CIs with tonal language-oriented speech processing strategies. The aim of the current study was to provide neural evidence of F0 processing in Mandarin-speaking kindergarten-aged children with CIs compared with NH children. MethodsPositive mismatch responses (p-MMRs) to the change of the two acoustic dimensions of F0 (F0 contour and F0 level) in Mandarin-speaking kindergarten-aged children with CIs (n = 19) and their age-matched NH peers (n = 21). ResultsThe two groups of children did not show any significant difference on the mean amplitude of p-MMR to either F0 contour or F0 level change. While the CI group exhibited a significantly shorter peak latency of p-MMR to F0 contour change than to F0 level change, an opposite pattern was observed in the NH group. DiscussionThis study revealed a higher sensitivity to F0 contour change than to F0 level change in children with CIs, which was different from that in NH children. The neural evidence of discrepant F0 processing between children with CIs and NH children in this study was consistent with the previously reported behavioral findings and may serve as a reference for the development and improvement of tonal language-oriented speech processing strategies.												0	2											DEC 8	2022	16								1045939	10.3389/fnins.2022.1045939	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.1045939												2026-01-16	WOS:000901998800001

In order to acquire word-meaning mappings, learners need to determine what the language-relevant phonological contrasts are in the language. In this study, we examined the influence of phonology on non-native word learning, determining whether the language-relevant phonological contrasts could be acquired by abstracting over multiple experiences, and whether awareness of these contrasts could be related to learning. We trained English- and Mandarin-native speakers with pseudowords via a cross-situational statistical learning task (CSL). Learners were able to acquire the phonological contrasts across multiple situations, but similar-sounding words (i.e., minimal pairs) were harder to acquire, and words that contrast in a non-native suprasegmental feature (i.e., Mandarin lexical tone) were even harder for English-speakers, even with extended exposure. Furthermore, awareness of the non-native phonology was not found to relate to learning.												3	3											JAN	2025	28	1					15	30		10.1017/S1366728923000986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728923000986		MAR 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001190399300001

Native speakers of Mandarin listened to manipulated tone tokens and selected the corresponding word from four visually presented words (objects in Experiment 1 and characters in Experiment 2) while their eye movements were monitored. The results showed that 87% of ultimate tone judgments were made according to offset pitch height. Tokens with high offset pitch were identified as Tone 2, and low offset pitch as Tone 3. A low turning point pitch served as a pivotal cue for Tone 3, and prompted more eye fixations on Tone 3 items, until the offset pitch directed significantly more fixations to the final tone choice. The findings support the view that lexical tone perception is an incremental process, in which pitch height at critical points serves as an important cue.

Sixteen CI participants received a five-session HVPT within a period of three weeks, whereas another 16 CI children were recruited without receiving any formal training. Lexical tone production was assessed with a picture naming task before the provision (pretest) and immediately after (posttest) and ten weeks after (follow-up test) the completion of the training protocol. The production samples were coded and analyzed acoustically. Despite considerable distinctions from the typical baselines of normal-hearing peers, the trained CI children exhibited significant improvements in Mandarin tone production from pretest to posttest in pitch height of T1, pitch slope of T2, and pitch curvature of T3. Moreover, the training-induced acoustic changes in the concave characteristic of the T3 contour was retained ten weeks after training termination. This study represents an initial acoustic investigation on HVPT-induced benefits in lexical tone production for the pediatric CI population, which provides valuable insights into applying this perceptual training technique as a viable tool in clinical practices.												3	3											OCT	2024	156	4					2299	2314		10.1121/10.0030466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0030466												2026-01-16	WOS:001335574000002

However, few if any studies have investigated the transfer from L1 tonal language to L2 stress language and the relative roles of different acoustic cues underlying the transfer. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the perception of English lexical stress between Mandarin and Cantonese speakers who learn English as a foreign language. The event-related potential measurements and the principal component analysis were conducted for the two groups to explore the roles of different acoustic cues in the perception of English speech. The results demonstrated that compared with the Mandarin group, the Cantonese speakers relied more on pitch information and the reliance holds even when all the three cues varied simultaneously. Therefore, it was concluded that prosodic transfer from L1 lexical tone to L2 lexical stress occurred at the acoustic level, and the native linguistic background shaped the manner how speakers perceived the L2 speech.												7	7											JUN	2020	238	6					1489	1498		10.1007/s00221-020-05823-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-020-05823-w		MAY 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000534430000001
J	Liu, LQ; Kager, R				Liu, Liquan; Kager, Rene			Perception of tones by infants learning a non-tone language	COGNITION				Article								This article examines the perception of tones by non-tone-language-learning (non-tone-learning) infants between 5 and 18 months in a study that reveals infants' initial sensitivity to tonal contrasts, deterioration yet plasticity of tonal sensitivity at the end of the first year, and a perceptual rebound in the second year. Dutch infants in five age groups were tested on their ability to discriminate a tonal contrast of Mandarin Chinese as well as a contracted tonal contrast. Infants are able to discriminate tonal contrasts at 5-6 months, and their tonal sensitivity deteriorates at around 9 months. However, the sensitivity rebound sat 17-18 months. Non-tone-learning infants' tonal perception is elastic, as is shown by the influence of acoustic salience and distributional learning: (1) a salient contrast may remain discriminable throughout infancy whereas a less salient one does not; (2) a bimodal distribution in tonal exposure increases non-tone-learning infants' discrimination ability during the trough in sensitivity to tonal contrasts at 11-12 months. These novel findings reveal non-tone-learning infant' U-shaped pattern in tone perception, and display their perceptual flexibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The possible effect of L1 (Cantonese) lexical tones on L2 (Mandarin) lexical tone learning was explored. Accuracy rate and error patterns were examined with an AX discrimination task and a forced-choice identification task. Forty-nine native Cantonese-speaking students aged 8 years participated in the study. Results revealed that these children exhibited nearly perfect performance in the discrimination of Mandarin tones. However, significant tone differences were detected in the identification task. Tone 4 (T4) was identified with the lowest accuracy, and T1 with the highest. Error analysis revealed that Mandarin T2-T3 was the most confusing pair, followed by the T1-T4 pair. The inherent phonetic similarity between lexical tones in a language and the tone similarities across languages may also have contributed to perception difficulties, which could help to refine and supplement the PAM in the tonal/suprasegmental domain.												13	14											MAY	2017	20	3					549	560		10.1017/S1366728916000195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728916000195												2026-01-16	WOS:000399401100007

Nevertheless, tone perception in infants from pitch accent and bilingual language backgrounds has not been well understood. The present study examined monolingual and bilingual Norwegian-learning infants' discrimination of two Cantonese tone contrasts at 5 and 10 months, ages corresponding to the onset and offset of perceptual attunement. Results showed that while monolingual infants were sensitive to the salient contrast, bilingual infants showed sensitivity to both contrasts at 10 months. In sum, infant age and bilingual language background affected discrimination. Pitch accent language experience or contrast salience may also play a role. The finding that early bilingual experience facilitated tone perception is of particular interest. It suggests that infant perception could be enhanced by a more complex linguistic environment on a broader level. As this was observed only at 10 months, cumulative exposure may be required for infants in a complex bilingual environment. Future studies should disambiguate explanations generated from the current finding, ranging from neurocognitive plasticity to perceptual salience, and from experience-dependent to independent possibilities.												2	2											DEC	2024	77								102003	10.1016/j.infbeh.2024.102003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2024.102003		NOV 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001359429800001

Individual differences have been attributed to several factors, such as the role that pitch plays in a learner's L1 to signal lexical meaning (L1 tonal status), the shape of the tones to be acquired (tone types), as well as extralinguistic factors (such as musical experience and working memory). Here, we ask whether learners from a spectrum of L1 tonal statuses (Dutch, Swedish and Japanese, and Thai) differ in their tone word learning facility, whilst we simultaneously investigate the effects of tone type, and musical experience and working memory. Our findings suggest that above and beyond L1 tonal status, the strongest predictor of tone word learning was pre-lexical tone processing (measured by a tone categorization task), although the strength of the link between pre-lexical and lexical processing may be modulated by L1 tonal status.												5	5											AUG	2024	27	4					729	743		10.1017/S1366728923000871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728923000871		DEC 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001129284100001

The genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution postulates that genes and language features coevolve, such that a population that is genetically predisposed to perceiving a particular linguistic feature would tend to adopt that feature in their language. Statistical studies that correlated a large number of genetic variants and linguistic features not only generated this hypothesis but also specifically pinpointed a linkage between ASPM and lexical tone. However, there is currently no direct evidence for this association and, therefore, the hypothesis. In an experimental study, we provide evidence to link ASPM with lexical tone perception in a sample of over 400 speakers of a tone language. In addition to providing the first direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis, our results have implications for further studies of linguistic anthropology and language disorders.												24	27											MAY	2020	6	22							eaba5090	10.1126/sciadv.aba5090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5090												2026-01-16	WOS:000537238200045

Brain imaging evidence indicates that it is associated with abnormal structural and functional connections in the fronto-temporal region. However, a holistic understanding of the anatomical topology underlying amusia is still lacking. Here, we used probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging tractography and graph theory to examine whole brain white matter structural connectivity in 31 Mandarin-speaking amusics and 24 age-and IQ-matched controls. Amusics showed significantly reduced global connectivity, as indicated by the abnormally decreased clustering coefficient (C-p) and increased normalized shortest path length (lambda) compared to the controls. Moreover, amusics exhibited enhanced nodal strength in the right inferior parietal lobule relative to controls. The co-existence of the lexical tone deficits was associated with even more deteriorated global network efficiency in amusics, as suggested by the significant correlation between the increments in normalized shortest path length (lambda) and the insensitivity in lexical tone perception. Our study is the first to reveal reduced global connectivity efficiency in amusics as well as an increase in the global connectivity cost due to the co-existed lexical tone deficits. Taken together these results provide a holistic perspective on the anatomical substrates underlying congenital amusia.												13	14											MAY 23	2016	6								26505	10.1038/srep26505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep26505												2026-01-16	WOS:000376241700001

Processing dependencies of segmental and suprasegmental information: effects of emotion, lexical tone, and consonant variation	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Human speech carries segmental (phonemic) as well as suprasegmental (non-phonemic) detail. The current study aims to determine the extent to which processing dependencies between segmental and suprasegmental cues are influenced by phonological and communicative relevance in the native language. In the present study, processing interactions between segmental (consonant) and two types of suprasegmental cues (lexical tone and emotion) were examined in Mandarin and English speakers using a speeded classification paradigm. Results revealed a distinct pattern of responses for each group: for both tone and emotion, Mandarin speakers demonstrated mutual and symmetrical processing dependencies. By contrast, English speakers exhibited reduced interference from suprasegmental tone variation on segmental processing than vice versa. However, English speakers exhibited greater interference from suprasegmental emotion judgements on segmental processing than vice versa. Results point to cross-linguistic differences in how suprasegmental cues are weighted and are discussed in terms of current models of the adult lexicon.												3	3												2016	31	8					989	999		10.1080/23273798.2016.1190850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2016.1190850												2026-01-16	WOS:000386162600003

Linear correlation analysis was performed to examine possible relationships between the tone-recognition performance of the CI children and the demographic factors. Study sample: Sixty-six prelingually deafened children with CIs and 52 normal-hearing (NH) children as controls participated in the study. Results: Children with CIs showed an overall poorer tone-recognition performance and were more susceptible to noise than their NH peers. Tone confusions between Mandarin tone 2 and tone 3 were most prominent in both CI and NH children except for in the poorest SNR conditions. Age at implantation was significantly correlated with tone-recognition performance of the CI children in noise. Conclusions: There is a marked deficit in tone recognition in prelingually deafened children with CIs, particularly in noise listening conditions. While factors that contribute to the large individual differences are still elusive, early implantation could be beneficial to tone development in pediatric CI users.												36	42												2017	56			2			S23	S30		10.1080/14992027.2016.1219073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2016.1219073												2026-01-16	WOS:000416647000004

Here we investigate the role of visual face and head information in the production and perception of the six Cantonese lexical tones. Experiment 1 (speech production) showed that tone category membership is predicted independently by each of three visual components, Head-only, Face-only, and combined Face&Head motion, that Face&Head combined is a better predictor than the sum of Head-only and Face-only, that Head-only was a better predictor than Face-only, and that up-down head motion may be involved. In Experiment 2 (speech perception) discrimination of Cantonese tones and phones (consonants and vowels) was investigated in AuditoryOnly (AO), Visual-Only (VO), and Auditory-Visual (AV) presentations of Face-only, Head-only or combined Face&Head information. There was successful visual discrimination of both phones and tones, but in different manners. For VO, face movement (Face-only, Face&Head) was sufficient for Phone discrimination, whereas both head and face (Face&Head) were necessary for Tone discrimination; and Phone discrimination was better for Face-only than Head-only, whereas Tone discrimination was the better for Head-only than Face-only. For visual augmentation of auditory information, (AV-AO)/AO), for Phones there was significant facilitation in Head-only and Face-only, but not Face&Head, whereas for Tones there was significant facilitation only in the Face&Head condition. Overall, head motion is integrally involved in the differential production of Cantonese tones and, as for consonants and vowels, there is visual perception of lexical tone, albeit based on entirely different cues: face motion is sufficient for phone perception (head motion is not necessary), whereas head motion is necessary but not sufficient for tone perception (Face&Head required). Head motion is integral both to the differential production of Cantonese tones and to the visual discrimination of those tones.												13	13											JUN	2022	141						40	55		10.1016/j.specom.2022.03.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2022.03.011		MAY 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000807757700003
J	Zhang, KL; Sjerps, MJ; Peng, G				Zhang, Kaile; Sjerps, Matthias J.; Peng, Gang			Integral perception, but separate processing: The perceptual normalization of lexical tones and vowels	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								In tonal languages, speech variability arises in both lexical tone (i.e., suprasegmentally) and vowel quality (segmentally). Listeners can use surrounding speech context to overcome variability in both speech cues, a process known as extrinsic normalization. Although vowels are the main carriers of tones, it is still unknown whether the combined percept (lexical tone and vowel quality) is normalized integrally or in partly separate processes. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the time course of lexical tone normalization and vowel normalization to answer this question. Cantonese adults listened to synthesized three-syllable stimuli in which the identity of a target syllable ? ambiguous between high vs. mid-tone (Tone condition) or between /o/ vs. /u/ (Vowel condition) ? was dependent on either the tone range (Tone condition) or the formant range (Vowel condition) of the first two syllables. It was observed that the ambiguous tone was more often interpreted as a high-level tone when the context had a relatively low pitch than when it had a high pitch (Tone condition). Similarly, the ambiguous vowel was more often interpreted as /o/ when the context had a relatively low formant range than when it had a relatively high formant range (Vowel condition). These findings show the typical pattern of extrinsic tone and vowel normalization. Importantly, the EEG results of participants showing the contrastive normalization effect demonstrated that the effects of vowel normalization could already be observed within the N2 time window (190?350 ms), while the first reliable effect of lexical tone normalization on cortical processing was observable only from the P3 time window (220?500 ms) onwards. The ERP patterns demonstrate that the contrastive perceptual normalization of lexical tones and that of vowels occur at least in partially separate time windows. This suggests that the extrinsic normalization can operate at the level of phonemes and tonemes separately instead of operating on the whole syllable at once.												15	16											JUN 18	2021	156								107839	10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.107839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.107839		APR 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000647485000004

With natural speech, Chinese cochlear implant (CI) users have difficulty perceiving voice pitch cues important for lexical tone perception; it is unclear whether this difficulty persists in Mandarin synthesized speech. In this study, intelligibility of naturally produced and synthesized Mandarin speech was measured in Chinese CI listeners; intelligibility was also measured in a control group of normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Five synthesized voices were selected to represent different talker genders (male, female, child), speaking rates (normal, slow), and speaking styles (emotional, accent). The data showed that while modern Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) systems can provide perfect speech intelligibility for NH listeners, overall intelligibility was much poorer for CI than for NH listeners. CI performance was significantly poorer with synthesized speech than with natural speech (p< 0.001). CI listeners were highly sensitive to the "extra-atypical" synthesized emotional and accented speech. Performance with each of the synthesized speech types was significantly correlated with performance with natural speech in CI users (p< 0.01 in all cases). While modern TTS systems offer educational and communication benefits to CI users and hearing-impaired individuals, the selection of synthesized voices should be carefully considered in education applications of TTS for hearing-impaired individuals, especially CI children, since poor intelligibility performance may affect language learning.

W.; Wang, Yue			Production-perception relationship of Mandarin tones as revealed by critical perceptual cues	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								The relationship of lexical tone production and perception has not been well studied. Using Mandarin tone, this research tests the hypothesis that a production-perception link is revealed by critical perceptual cues. The critical status of perceptual tonal cues was determined by perceptual cue weights, showing fundamental frequency (F0) contour as being more critical than height. Then, tone production features were examined for critical F0 contour (slope, curvature, turning-point location) and non-critical F0 height (mean, onset) cues. A production-perception correlation was found for F0 contour but not height cues, suggesting that critical perceptual cues dictate the relationship between production and perception.												8	9											APR	2020	147	4					EL301	EL306		10.1121/10.0000963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0000963												2026-01-16	WOS:000524220200001

Auditory processing, linguistic prosody awareness, and word reading in Mandarin-speaking children learning English	READING AND WRITING				Article								This study examined language-specific links among auditory processing, linguistic prosody awareness, and Mandarin (L1) and English (L2) word reading in 61 Mandarin-speaking, English-learning children. Three auditory discrimination abilities were measured: pitch contour, pitch interval, and rise time (rate of intensity change at tone onset). Linguistic prosody awareness was measured three ways: Mandarin tone perception, English stress perception, and English stress production. A Chinese character recognition task was the Mandarin L1 reading metric. English L2 word reading was assessed by English real word reading and nonword decoding tasks. The importance of the auditory processing measures to reading was different in the two languages. Pitch contour discrimination predicted Mandarin L1 word reading and rise time discrimination predicted English L2 word reading, after controlling for age and nonverbal IQ. For the prosodic and phonological measures, Mandarin tone perception, but not rhyme awareness, predicted Chinese character recognition after controlling for age and nonverbal IQ. In contrast, English rhyme awareness predicted more unique variance in English real word reading and nonword decoding than did English stress perception and production. Linguistic prosody awareness appears to play a more important role in L1 word reading than phonological awareness; while the reverse seems true for English L2 word reading in Mandarin-speaking children. Taken together, auditory processing, language-specific linguistic prosody awareness, and phonological awareness play different roles in L1/L2 reading, reflecting different prosodic and segmental structures between Mandarin and English.												22	24											SEP	2017	30	7					1407	1429		10.1007/s11145-017-9730-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11145-017-9730-8												2026-01-16	WOS:000406496800002

Speech perception in Mandarin-speaking children with cochlear implants: A systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY				Review								Objective: This paper reviewed the literature on the trajectories and the factors significantly affecting post-implantation speech perception development in Mandarin-speaking children with cochlear implants (CIs). Design: A systematic literature search of textbooks and peer-reviewed published journal articles in online bibliographic databases was conducted. Study sample: PubMed, Scopus and Wiley online library were searched for eligible studies based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: A total of 14 journal articles were selected for this review. A number of consistent results were found. That is, children with CIs, as a group, exhibited steep improvement in early speech perception, from exhibiting few prelingual auditory behaviours before implantation to identifying sentences in noise after one year of CI use. After one to three years of CI use, children are expected to identify tones above chance and recognition of words in noise. In addition, early age at implantation, longer duration of CI use and higher maternal education level contributed to greater improvements in speech perception. Conclusions: Findings from this review will contribute to the establishment of appropriate short-term developmental goals for Mandarin-speaking children with CIs in mainland China and clinicians could use them to determine whether children have made appropriate progress with CIs.												33	41												2017	56			2			S7	S16		10.1080/14992027.2017.1300694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2017.1300694												2026-01-16	WOS:000416647000002
J	Tang, W; Xiong, W; Zhang, YX; Dong, Q; Nan, Y				Tang, Wei; Xiong, Wen; Zhang, Yu-xuan; Dong, Qi; Nan, Yun			Musical experience facilitates lexical tone processing among Mandarin speakers: Behavioral and neural evidence	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Music and speech share many sound attributes. Pitch, as the percept of fundamental frequency, often occupies the center of researchers' attention in studies on the relationship between music and speech. One widely held assumption is that music experience may confer an advantage in speech tone processing. The cross-domain effects of musical training on non-tonal language speakers' linguistic pitch processing have been relatively well established. However, it remains unclear whether musical experience improves the processing of lexical tone for native tone language speakers who actually use lexical tones in their daily communication. Using a passive oddball paradigm, the present study revealed that among Mandarin speakers, musicians demonstrated enlarged electrical responses to lexical tone changes as reflected by the increased mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes, as well as faster behavioral discrimination performance compared with age- and IQ-matched nonmusicians. The current results suggest that in spite of the preexisting long-term experience with lexical tones in both musicians and non musicians, musical experience can still modulate the cortical plasticity of linguistic tone processing and is associated with enhanced neural processing of speech tones. Our current results thus provide the first electrophysiological evidence supporting the notion that pitch expertise in the music domain may indeed be transferable to the speech domain even for native tone language speakers.

In addition, we evaluated the relationship between tonal identification development and working memory capacity.Method: Ninety-three typically developing children aged 5-8 years and 23 young adults completed categorical identification of two tonal continua (Tone 1-4 and Tone 2-3) in quiet, SSN, and babble noise. Their working memory was additionally measured using auditory digit span tests. Correlation analyses between digit span scores and boundary widths were performed.Results: Six-year-old children have achieved the adultlike ability of categorical identification of Tone 1-4 continuum under both types of noise. Moreover, 6 year-old children could identify Tone 2-3 continuum as well as adults in SSN. Nonetheless, the child participants, even 8-year-olds, performed worse when tokens from Tone 2-3 continuum were masked by babble noise. Greater working memory capacity was associated with better tone identification in noise for preschoolers aged 5-6 years; however, for school-age children aged 7-8 years, such correlation only existed in Tone 2-3 continuum in SSN.Conclusions: Lexical tone perception might take a prolonged time to achieve adultlike competence in babble noise relative to SSN. Moreover, a significant interaction between masking type and stimulus difficulty was found, as indicated by Tone 2-3 being more susceptible to interference from babble noise than Tone 1-4. Furthermore, correlations between working memory capacity and tone perception in noise varied with developmental stage, stimulus difficulty, and masking type.												6	6											OCT	2023	66	10					4100	4116		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00457												2026-01-16	WOS:001146442500017
J	Yuan, JH				Yuan, Jiahong			Perception of intonation in Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								There is a tendency across languages to use a rising pitch contour to convey question intonation and a falling pitch contour to convey a statement. In a lexical tone language such as Mandarin Chinese, rising and falling pitch contours are also used to differentiate lexical meaning. How, then, does the multiplexing of the F-0 channel affect the perception of question and statement intonation in a lexical tone language? This study investigated the effects of lexical tones and focus on the perception of intonation in Mandarin Chinese. The results show that lexical tones and focus impact the perception of sentence intonation. Question intonation was easier for native speakers to identify on a sentence with a final falling tone and more difficult to identify on a sentence with a final rising tone, suggesting that tone identification intervenes in the mapping of F-0 contours to intonational categories and that tone and intonation interact at the phonological level. In contrast, there is no evidence that the interaction between focus and intonation goes beyond the psychoacoustic level. The results provide insights that will be useful for further research on tone and intonation interactions in both acoustic modeling studies and neurobiological studies.

An event-related brain potential analysis of tone processing in Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH				Article								In Mandarin Chinese, word meaning is partially determined by lexical tone (Wang, 1973). Previous studies suggest that lexical tone is processed as linguistic information and not as pure tonal information (Gandour, 1998; Van Lanker & Fromkin, 1973). The current study explored the online processing of lexical tones. Event-related potentials were obtained from 25 Mandarin speakers while they listened to normal and anomalous sentences containing one of three types of semantic anomalies created by manipulating the tone, the syllable, or both tone and syllable (double-anomaly) of sentence-final words. We hypothesized N400 effects elicited by all three types of anomalies and the largest by the double-anomaly. As expected, all three elicited N400 effects starting approximately 150 ms poststimulus and continuing until 1000 ms in some areas. Surprisingly, onset of the double-anomaly effect was approximately 50 ms later than the rest. Delayed detection of errors in this condition may be responsible for the apparent delay. Slight differences between syllable and tone conditions may be due to the relative timing of these acoustic cues.												48	55											MAR	2004	33	2					103	135		10.1023/B:JOPR.0000017223.98667.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPR.0000017223.98667.10												2026-01-16	WOS:000189208300002

In the working memory task, early-emerging good readers outperformed both early-emerging average and poor readers, who performed similarly. No significant group differences were found in lexical tone awareness, musical rhythm perception, musical pitch perception, or non-verbal intelligence.Discussion The results reflect phonological deficits in early-emerging poor readers. Furthermore, phonological awareness and working memory were useful for identifying early-emerging poor and good readers, respectively. Clinically, these findings imply that early-emerging poor readers may benefit most from initial phonological awareness training, followed by working memory training. Moreover, working memory training may also be beneficial for early-emerging average readers seeking to improve their Chinese word reading.												0	0											AUG 29	2025	16								1563491	10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1563491	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1563491												2026-01-16	WOS:001569202900001
J	Connell, B				Connell, B			The perception of lexical tone in Mambila	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								The issue of the perception of lexical tone has been addressed mainly through studies of Southeast Asian languages which feature phonological contour tones as well as level tones. Little attention has been paid to African languages which have, almost exclusively, only level tones. This paper examines tone perception in Mambila, a Benue-Congo language with four level lexical tones. A categorization experiment was run to determine some of the salient aspects of the perceptual nature of these tones. Since the four tones are well defined with respect to production, we sought to determine whether this characteristic carried over into perception, the expectation being that experimental stimuli, on the basis of pitch height alone, would fall into four reasonably well defined categories. Results showed interesting differences across the four tones, with indications that the two Mid tones, T2 and T3, are perceptually different than the High (T1) and Low (T4) tones. The experiment was run a second time, using a group of native English listeners, to assess to what extent results for the Mambila listeners were determined by the perceptual structure of the Mambila tone system. A Signal Detection analysis was used, which revealed important differences between the two groups of listeners. Results are discussed in light of what is known about universal tendencies of tone systems and the historical development of the Mambila system.												18	24											APR-JUN	2000	43		2				163	182		10.1177/00238309000430020201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00238309000430020201												2026-01-16	WOS:000089627600002

This result is consistent with the hypothesis that tone perception is the prerequisite for good tone production. Objectives: Previous research has shown remarkable deficits in tone perception and production in native tone language-speaking, prelingually deafened children with cochlear implants. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between tone perception and production in those children. Methods: Twenty-five prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants participated in the study. All subjects were Advanced Bionics CII/90K users with various lengths of implant use. To evaluate tone perception performance, subjects completed a computerized tone contrast test. For tone production performance, an artificial neural network was used to evaluate the accuracy of tones recorded from each of the 25 subjects. Results: Large individual differences in tone perception and production performance were observed in these subjects. Tone perception accuracy ranged from 50.0 to 96.9% correct (chance performance == 50% correct; mean == 71.0% correct). Tone production performance ranged from 19.4 to 97.2% correct (mean == 52.0% correct). A strong correlation was found between tone perception and production performance in this group of subjects (r == 0.805).												55	62											APR	2011	131	4					395	398		10.3109/00016489.2010.536993	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00016489.2010.536993												2026-01-16	WOS:000288328000010

The roles of tonal and segmental information in Mandarin spoken word recognition: An eyetracking study	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE				Article								We used eyetracking to examine how tonal versus segmental information influence spoken word recognition in Mandarin Chinese. Participants heard an auditory word and were required to identify its corresponding picture from an array that included the target item (chuang2 'bed'), a phonological competitor (segmental: chuang1 'window'; cohort: chuan2 'ship'; rhyme: huang2 'yellow': tonal: niu2 'cow'), and two phonologically unrelated distractors. Growth curve analysis was used to characterize the trajectory of looks to target and competitor items during word processing. We found similar model fits for the segmental and cohort conditions characterized by slower eye movements to correct targets compared to baseline, suggesting that tonal and segmental information are accessed concurrently and play comparable roles in constraining activation. These findings are discussed with respect to current models of spoken word recognition that have not previously accounted for the role of tone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Thai offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of lexical tone processing during visual-word recognition, as tone is explicitly expressed in its script. We used colour words and their orthographic neighbours as stimuli to investigate facilitation (Experiment 1) and interference (Experiment 2) Stroop effects. Five experimental conditions were created: (a) the colour word (e. g kha: w/ [ white]), (b) tone different word (e. g khw/[ news]), (c) initial consonant phonologically same word (e. gkha: w/[ fishy]), where the initial consonant of the word was phonologically the same but orthographically different, (d) initial consonant different, tone same word (e. gha: w/yawn), where the initial consonant was orthographically different but the tone of the word was the same, and (e) initial consonant different, tone different word (e. gka: w/glue), where the initial consonant was orthographically different, and the tone was different. In order to examine whether tone information per se had a facilitative effect, we also included a colour congruent word condition where the segmental (S) information was different but the tone (T) matched the colour word (S-T+) in Experiment 2. Facilitation/interference effects were found for all five conditions when compared with a neutral control word. Results of the critical comparisons revealed that tone information comes into play at a later stage in lexical processing, and orthographic information contributes more than phonological information.												3	3												2017	70	7					1282	1291		10.1080/17470218.2016.1181095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2016.1181095												2026-01-16	WOS:000396826100014

Relative contributions of vowels and consonants in recognizing isolated Mandarin words	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study investigated the relative contributions of vowels and consonants in recognizing isolated Mandarin words. Normal-hearing native-Mandarin listeners were instructed to recognize isolated Mandarin words and identify consonants, vowels and tones with stimuli synthesized to contain different proportions of consonant or vowel segments, including five conditions of consonant-only, vowel-only, consonant or vowel plus consonant-vowel (C-V) transition, and C-V transition. The recognition score of the vowel-only Mandarin words was significantly higher than that of the consonant-only words; and word recognition scores had a higher correlation with vowel identification scores than consonant identification scores. Moreover, adding a small portion of C-V transition significantly improved the recognition score of the consonant-only Mandarin words. In the conditions of C-V transition and consonant plus C-V transition, the duration of preserved portion predicted modestly well the scores of isolated word recognition, and vowel, consonant and lexical tone identification in Mandarin. These findings suggest that there is a greater contribution of vowels than consonants to isolated word recognition in Mandarin, which is different from previous outcomes in English.

J	Cooper, A; Wang, Y				Cooper, Angela; Wang, Yue			Effects of tone training on Cantonese tone-word learning	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								The present study examined the effect of improving lexical tone identification abilities on Cantonese tone-word learning. Native English non-musicians received training on Cantonese tones before learning the meanings of words distinguished by these tones. Their results were compared to English non-musicians and musicians who received no tone training. The tone-trainees obtained a similar level of word identification proficiency as musicians by the end of training and were significantly better than non-tone trained non-musicians. These results lend support for phonetic-phonological-lexical continuity in learning because enhancing listeners' perception of lower-level tonal information significantly contributed to success in a higher-level linguistic task.

A Cross-linguistic Examination of Toddlers' Interpretation of Vowel Duration	INFANCY				Article								Languages differ in their phonological use of vowel duration. For the child, learning how duration contributes to lexical contrast is complicated because segmental duration is implicated in many different linguistic distinctions. Using a language-guided looking task, we measured English and Dutch 21-month-olds' recognition of familiar words with normal or manipulated vowel durations. Dutch but not English learners were affected by duration changes, even though distributions of short and long vowels in both languages are similar, and English uses vowel duration as a cue to (for example) consonant coda voicing. Additionally, we found that word recognition in Dutch toddlers was affected by shortening but not lengthening of vowels, matching an asymmetry also found in Dutch adults. Considering the subtlety of the cross-linguistic difference in the input, and the complexity of duration as a phonetic feature, our results suggest a strong capacity for phonetic analysis in children before their second birthday.												3	3											MAY-JUN	2019	24	3					300	317		10.1111/infa.12280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12280												2026-01-16	WOS:000463026200001

Developmental change in tone perception in Mandarin monolingual, English monolingual, and Mandarin-English bilingual infants: Divergences between monolingual and bilingual learners	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Most languages use lexical tone to discriminate the meanings of words. There has been recent interest in tracking the development of tone categories during infancy. These studies have focused largely on monolingual infants learning either a tone language or a non-tone language. It remains to be seen how bilingual infants learning one tone language (e.g., Mandarin) and one non-tone language (e.g., English) discriminate tones. Here, we examined infants' discrimination of two Mandarin tones pairs: one salient and one subtle. Discrimination was investigated in three groups: Mandarin-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and Mandarin monolinguals at 6 months and 9 months of age in a cross-sectional design. Results demonstrated relatively strong Mandarin tone discrimination in Mandarin monolinguals, with salient tone discrimination at 6 months and both salient and subtle tone discrimination at 9 months. English monolinguals discriminated neither contrast at 6 months but discriminated the salient contrast at 9 months. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for tone discrimination in Mandarin-English bilingual infants. In a second experiment, 12- and 13-month-old Mandarin-English bilingual and English monolingual infants were tested to determine whether bilinguals would demonstrate tone sensitivity at a later age. Results revealed a lack of tone sensitivity at 12 or 13 months in bilingual infants, yet English monolingual infants were sensitive to both salient and subtle Mandarin tone contrasts at 12 or 13 months. Our findings provide evidence for age-related convergence in Mandarin tone discrimination in English and Mandarin monolingual infants and for a distinct pattern of tone discrimination in bilingual infants. Theoretical implications for phonetic category acquisition are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

From Flexibility to Constraint: The Contrastive Use of Lexical Tone in Early Word Learning	CHILD DEVELOPMENT				Article								Infants must develop both flexibility and constraint in their interpretation of acceptable word forms. The current experiments examined the development of infants' lexical interpretation of non-native variations in pitch contour. Fourteen-, 17-, and 19-month-olds (Experiments 1 and 2, N=72) heard labels for two novel objects; labels contained the same syllable produced with distinct pitch contours (Mandarin lexical tones). The youngest infants learned the label-object mappings, but the older groups did not, despite being able to discriminate pitch differences in an object-free task (Experiment 3, N=14). Results indicate that 14-month-olds remain flexible regarding what sounds make meaningful distinctions between words. By 17-19months, experience with a nontonal native language constrains infants' interpretation of lexical tone.												66	72											JAN-FEB	2015	86	1					10	22		10.1111/cdev.12269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12269												2026-01-16	WOS:000349773400002

Results revealed that even if the amusic group performed significantly below the control group, the scores of the two groups largely overlapped, with only 15% of the amusic group performing outside the normal variations. Thus, the findings suggest a modest transfer of deficit between music and speech, which in turn calls for further work in order to identify the nature of the mediating factors.												32	37												2009	1169						490	493		10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04855.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04855.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000269652300073

Idiomatic materials, providing semantically highly constraining contexts, were utilized. Besides being presented normally, the terminal monosyllabic words in idioms were manipulated with Tonal, Vowel, or Triple violations (i.e. with consonantal, tonal, and vowel mismatches). Event-related potential results showed that all three violations elicited larger widespread negativities in comparison with the Control condition, with the Triple violation effect starting first from 150ms, then the Vowel violation, and the Tonal violation being the latest. The different starting times of the violation effects suggest that the access of tonal information is slower than that of vowel information, even though the lexical tones are very important in distinguishing the meaning of Chinese words.												8	9											MAR 21	2018	29	5					356	362		10.1097/WNR.0000000000000973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0000000000000973												2026-01-16	WOS:000428181100004

Lexical tone perception in native speakers of Cantonese	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY				Article								Purpose. This study aimed at investigating (1) tone perception development among typically-developing Cantonese speakers and (2) the hierarchy of tone perception difficulty among the 15 tone contrasts. Method. Two-hundred typically-developing children aged 3-10 and a group of 25 normal hearing adults were recruited. They were tested on a pool of 75-item calibrated recorded speech signals. Participants responded to each stimulus by pointing at the corresponding picture displayed on a computer screen from a choice of four. Result. There was a gradual increase in tone perception accuracy from children aged 3-6. After age 6, tone perception accuracy was similar to adults with an average error rate of 3-8%. The two tone contrasts that listeners consistently found difficult to distinguish were T2T5 (high-rising vs low-rising) and T3T6 (mid-level vs low-level). In addition, all children groups also showed difficulty in T4T6 identification (low-falling vs low-level). Conclusion. Tone perception is not error-free even among native Cantonese-speaking adults. Overall tone identification performance improved steadily from age 3 to age 6. Based on the participants' performance, a three-tier set of tone groups, with an increasing level of difficulty for identification, is proposed for rehabilitation purposes. These tone groups are (1) Easy: T1T2, T1T3, T1T4, T1T5, T1T6, and T2T3, (2) Medium: T2T4, T2T6, T3T4, and T4T5, and (3) Hard: T2T5, T3T5, T3T6, T4T6, and T5T6.												23	29											FEB	2015	17	1					53	62		10.3109/17549507.2014.898096	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/17549507.2014.898096												2026-01-16	WOS:000348043900005

Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.												0	0											JAN 1	2026	38	1					158	173		10.1162/JOCN.a.76	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/JOCN.a.76												2026-01-16	WOS:001641426400011

Method: Participants were 14 five-year-old children with SLI, and 14 age-matched (AM) and 13 four-year-old vocabulary-matched (VM) controls. The children identified a word from familiar word pairs that illustrated the 8 minimally contrastive pairs of the 6 lexical tones. They discriminated the f0 patterns within contrastive tonal pairs in speech and nonspeech stimuli. Results: In tone identification, the SLI group performed worse than the AM group but not the VM group. In tone discrimination, the SLI group did worse than the AM group on 2 contrasts and showed a nonsignificant trend of poorer performance on all contrasts combined. The VM group generally did worse than the AM group. There were no group differences in discrimination performance between speech and nonspeech stimuli. No correlation was found between identification and discrimination performance. Only the normal controls showed a moderate correlation between vocabulary scores and performance in the 2 perception tasks. Conclusion: The SLI group's poor tone identification cannot be accounted for by vocabulary knowledge alone. The group's tone discrimination performance suggests that some children with SLI have a deficit in f0 processing.												26	29											DEC 1	2009	52	6					1493	1509		10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0170)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0170)												2026-01-16	WOS:000272482700007

Investigating the role of musical experience in lexical tone perception: non-musicians and amateur musicians' perception of Mandarin tones	PHONETICA				Article								Previous studies have found that musicians typically discriminate Mandarin tones better than non-musicians. However, the relationship between musical experience and tone perception is unclear. In the current study, 39 monolingual native English speakers with no previous experience of tone languages and a range of musical backgrounds (non-musicians and amateur musicians) completed 6 tasks, including lexical tone identification, working memory, test of first language (L1) and second language (L2) segmental perception and the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index which measures musical ability and experience. Results indicated that tone identification was significantly correlated with music training, musical ability, and pitch discrimination. However, a path analysis showed that pitch discrimination and musical ability, but not music training, directly influenced tone identification. Music training had a positive direct influence on pitch discrimination and musical ability, and indirectly influences tone identification via these mediators. Follow-up multivariate multiple regression showed that different tones are affected differently: pitch discrimination ability mainly influenced identification of Tones 3 and 4, while musical ability significantly influenced Tones 1 and 4. Overall, na & iuml;ve, non-tone language speakers do not need music training or a musical background to be able to identify Mandarin tones with a high degree of accuracy.												0	0											OCT 27	2025	82	5					307	329		10.1515/phon-2024-0055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/phon-2024-0055												2026-01-16	WOS:001610491000002

A total of 172 Chinese children from third grade to sixth grade in Taiwanese primary schools were recruited. Thirty (14 male) children were identified as having dyslexia, and the remaining children (N = 142; 67 male) were typically developing children matched with those with dyslexia as carefully as possible with respect to school, grade, and gender. Our results indicated that group differences were found for all three types of prosodic sensitivity. Moderation analyses showed that group had no significant interaction with prosodic sensitivity in predicting Chinese reading, so the participants in the two groups were combined in the following analyses. The results of the stepwise regression analyses showed that only lexical tone awareness could significantly predict Chinese character reading after controlling for phonological awareness, while only intonation awareness could significantly predict reading comprehension after controlling for Chinese character reading. The results provide preliminary evidence on the issue of prosodic sensitivity in Chinese children with dyslexia and its role in Chinese reading, which might provide a novel approach to the teaching of Chinese languages.												6	6											AUG	2022	28	3					342	358		10.1002/dys.1720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dys.1720		JUL 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000820578800001

M.; Chandrasekaran, Bharath			Task-General and Acoustic-Invariant Neural Representation of Speech Categories in the Human Brain	CEREBRAL CORTEX				Article								A significant neural challenge in speech perception includes extracting discrete phonetic categories from continuous and multidimensional signals despite varying task demands and surface-acoustic variability. While neural representations of speech categories have been previously identified in frontal and posterior temporal-parietal regions, the task dependency and dimensional specificity of these neural representations are still unclear. Here, we asked native Mandarin participants to listen to speech syllables carrying 4 distinct lexical tone categories across passive listening, repetition, and categorization tasks while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used searchlight classification and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify the dimensional structure underlying neural representation across tasks and surface-acoustic properties. Searchlight classification analyses revealed significant "cross-task" lexical tone decoding within the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). RSA revealed that the LIPL and LSTG, in contrast to the RSTG, relate to 2 critical dimensions (pitch height, pitch direction) underlying tone perception. Outside this core representational network, we found greater activation in the inferior frontal and parietal regions for stimuli that are more perceptually similar during tone categorization. Our findings reveal the specific characteristics of fronto-tempo-parietal regions that support speech representation and categorization processing.												40	47											SEP	2018	28	9					3241	3254		10.1093/cercor/bhx195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx195												2026-01-16	WOS:000443545600014

The Effect of Lexical Tone and Sex on Nasalance in Cantonese-Speakers	CLEFT PALATE CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL				Article; Early Access								Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effect of lexical tone and sex on nasalance in Cantonese, a lexical tone language, and to identify both statistical and clinical implications. Design: Forty Cantonese-speaking adults were recruited; 72 stimuli words based on 12 syllables across 3 syllable types (CV, CVV, CVC) and 6 lexical tones were constructed. Each stimulus was repeated 6 times, resulting in 1296 repetitions randomized for each participant. Acoustic data were annotated and mean nasalance extracted from the Nasometer (TM) software. Results: A 3-way mixed analysis of variance with sex as the between-subjects factor and syllable type and tones as the within-subjects factors showed a significant 3-way interaction effect, F(5.491,647.953) = 6.759, P < .001, partial eta(2) = .054, a significant 2-way interaction effect of syllable type x tone, F(5.491,647.953) = 57.524, P < .001, partial eta(2) = .328, and significant main effects, for example, sex, F(1118) = 12.078, P = .001, partial eta(2) = .093. Females had higher nasalance than males across all syllable types. Tone 1 words and CVC syllable type yielded the highest nasalance values. Conclusions: Study findings show an effect of lexical tone and syllable type on nasalance for males and females. The theory of transpalatal acoustic transmission is used to explain and discuss study findings. Clinical implications pertain to the potential need for separate normative databases for males and females and control of tone 1 words and syllable type (CVC) with final syllable nasal, in nasalance speech sampling material and in cross-linguistic comparisons.												0	0											2025 OCT 27	2025										10.1177/10556656251390301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10556656251390301		OCT 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001602732700001
J	Tsiwah, F; Popov, S; Bastiaanse, R				Tsiwah, Frank; Popov, Srdjan; Bastiaanse, Roelien			Perception of grammatical tone in Akan patients with left and right hemisphere brain damage	CLINICAL LINGUISTICS & PHONETICS				Article								It remains a matter of debate what roles the left and right hemispheres play in processing speech prosody. Brain lesion studies have demonstrated that lexical tone perception among native speakers of tonal languages is more disrupted in left hemisphere damaged (LHD) individuals than right hemisphere damaged (RHD) individuals. This has been taken to suggest that linguistically-relevant prosodic cues are predominantly left-lateralised, whereas non-linguistic stimuli are predominantly right-lateralised. However, this phenomenon has only been examined in lexical tone, leaving grammatical tone perception unexplored. The aim of this study was twofold: Firstly, to examine how individuals with LHD and RHD perceive grammatical tone, and secondly to compare grammatical tone to non-linguistic tone perception. Therefore, native Akan speakers with LHD, RHD and no-brain damage (NBD) controls were tested in two discrimination tasks that examined linguistic and non-linguistic tone perception. The results showed that while both the individuals with LHD and RHD show impairment in grammatical tone perception, there was a trend of a better performance for the RHD group. Nonetheless, for non-linguistic tone perception, individuals with LHD outperformed the RHD individuals, although both had reduced performance compared to the NBD individuals. A further analysis revealed that the reduced perceptual abilities of both the LHD and RHD groups in grammatical tone perception can be attributed to grammatical problems rather than tone per se. We conclude that there is potentially a bilateral involvement of the two hemispheres in grammatical tone processing, with the left being the dominant hemisphere.												1	1											MAY 3	2024	38	5					399	417		10.1080/02699206.2023.2216347	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2023.2216347		JUN 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000999992500001
J	Zhang, H; Wiener, S; Holt, LL				Zhang, Hui; Wiener, Seth; Holt, Lori L.			Adjustment of cue weighting in speech by speakers and listeners: Evidence from amplitude and duration modifications of Mandarin Chinese tone	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Speech contrasts are signaled by multiple acoustic dimensions, but these dimensions are not equally diagnostic. Moreover, the relative diagnosticity, or weight, of acoustic dimensions in speech can shift in different communicative contexts for both speech perception and speech production. However, the literature remains unclear on whether, and if so how, talkers adjust speech to emphasize different acoustic dimensions in the context of changing communicative demands. Here, we examine the interplay of flexible cue weights in speech production and perception across amplitude and duration, secondary non-spectral acoustic dimensions for phonated Mandarin Chinese lexical tone, across natural speech and whispering, which eliminates fundamental frequency contour, the primary acoustic dimension. Phonated and whispered Mandarin productions from native talkers revealed enhancement of both duration and amplitude cues in whispered, compared to phonated speech. When nonspeech amplitude-modulated noises modeled these patterns of enhancement, identification of the noises as Mandarin lexical tone categories was more accurate than identification of noises modeling phonated speech amplitude and duration cues. Thus, speakers exaggerate secondary cues in whispered speech and listeners make use of this information. Yet, enhancement is not symmetric among the four Mandarin lexical tones, indicating possible constraints on the realization of this enhancement.

Identification of multi-speaker Mandarin tones in noise by native and non-native listeners	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								The similarities and contrasts between native and non-native identification of multi-speaker Mandarin tones in quiet and in noise were explored in a perception experiment. Mandarin tone materials produced by three male and three female speakers were presented with five levels of signal-to-noise ratios (quiet, 0, -5, -10, and -15 dB) in two presentation formats (blocked by speaker and mixed across speakers) to listeners with various Mandarin experience (native, first-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year students). Stimuli blocked by speaker yielded higher accuracy and shorter reaction time. The additional demand of processing mixed-speaker stimuli, however, did not compromise non-native performance more than native performance. Noise expectedly compromised identification performance, although it did not compromise non-native identification more than native identification. Native listeners expectedly outperformed non-native listeners, although identification performance did not vary systematically as a function of duration of Mandarin experience. It is speculated that sources of variability in speech would affect non-native more than native tone identification only if syllable-internal, canonical F0 information is removed or altered.

J	Zhang, L; Zhu, JQ; Shao, J; Zhang, CC				Zhang, Liang; Zhu, Jiaqiang; Shao, Jing; Zhang, Caicai			The combined effects of bilingualism and musicianship on listeners' perception of non-native lexical tones	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								Non-native lexical tone perception can be affected by listeners' musical or linguistic experience, but it remains unclear of whether there will be combined effects and how these impacts will be modulated by different types of non-native tones. This study adopted an orthogonal design with four participant groups, namely, Mandarin-L1 monolinguals and Mandarin-L1 and Cantonese-L2 bilinguals with or without musical training, to investigate effects of bilingualism and musicianship on perception of non-native lexical tones. The closely matched four groups, each encompassing an equal number of 20 participants, attended a modified ABX discrimination task of lexical tones of Teochew, which was unknown to all participants and consists of multiple tone types of level tones, contour tones, and checked tones. The tone perceptual sensitivity index of d' values and response times were calculated and compared using linear mixed-effects models. Results on tone sensitivity and response time revealed that all groups were more sensitive to contour tones than level tones, indicating the effect of native phonology of Mandarin tones on non-native tone perception. Besides, as compared to monolinguals, bilinguals obtained a higher d' value when discriminating non-native tones, and musically trained bilinguals responded faster than their non-musician peers. It indicates that bilinguals enjoy a perceptual advantage in non-native tone perception, with musicianship further enhancing this advantage. This extends prior studies by showing that an L2 with a more intricate tone inventory than L1 could facilitate listeners' non-native tone perception. The pedagogical implications were discussed.												5	5											NOV	2024	165								103147	10.1016/j.specom.2024.103147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2024.103147		NOV 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001357541900001

Neural networks in the form of self-organizing maps (SOMs; Kohonen, 1989, 1995) were used to simulate unsupervised learning of Mandarin tones. In Simulation 1, we trained the SOMs with syllable-sized continuous F-0 contours, produced by multiple speakers in connected speech, and with the corresponding velocity profiles (D1). No attempt was made to reduce the large amount of variability in the input or to add to the input any abstract features such as height and slope of the F-0 contours. In the testing phase, reasonably high categorization rate was achieved with F-0 profiles, but D1 profiles yielded almost perfect categorization of the four tones. Close inspection of the learned prototypical D1 profile clusters revealed that they had effectively eliminated surface variability and directly reflected articulatory movements toward the underlying targets of the four tones as proposed by Xu and Wang (2001). Additional simulations indicated that a further learning step was possible through which D1 prototypes with one-to-one correspondence to the tones were derived from the prototype clusters learned in Simulation 1. Implications of these findings for theories of language acquisition, speech perception and speech production are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, F; Chen, J				Chen, Fei; Chen, Jing			Effects of fundamental frequency contour on understanding Mandarin sentences in bimodal hearing simulations	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Fundamental frequency (F0) contour carries important information for understanding a tonal language. The present work assessed the effects of F0 contour on understanding Mandarin sentences in bimodal hearing simulations, including three conditions of acousticonly, electric-only, and combined stimulations. Test stimuli were synthesized Mandarin sentences, each word with a normal, flat, or randomly assigned lexical tone, and presented to normal-hearing Mandarin-speaking listeners to recognize. Experimental results showed that changing F0 contour significantly affected the perception of Mandarin sentences under all conditions of acoustic-only, electric-only, and combined stimulations. The combined-stimulation advantage was only observed for test stimuli with the normal F0 contour.

Neural bases of congenital amusia in tonal language speakers	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Congenital amusia is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder of fine-grained pitch processing. In this fMRI study, we examined the neural bases of congenial amusia in speakers of a tonal language Cantonese. Previous studies on non-tonal language speakers suggest that the neural deficits of congenital amusia lie in the music selective neural circuitry in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, it is unclear whether this finding can generalize to congenital amusics in tonal languages. Tonal language experience has been reported to shape the neural processing of pitch, which raises the question of how tonal language experience affects the neural bases of congenital amusia. To investigate this question, we examined the neural circuitries sub-serving the processing of relative pitch interval in pitch-matched Cantonese level tone and musical stimuli in 11 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 11 musically intact controls. Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited abnormal brain activities in a widely distributed neural network during the processing of lexical tone and musical stimuli. Whereas the controls exhibited significant activation in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the lexical tone condition and in the cerebellum regardless of the lexical tone and music conditions, no activation was found in the amusics in those regions, which likely reflects a dysfunctional neural mechanism of relative pitch processing in the amusics. Furthermore, the amusics showed abnormally strong activation of the right middle frontal gyrus and precuneus when the pitch stimuli were repeated, which presumably reflect deficits of attending to repeated pitch stimuli or encoding them into working memory. No significant group difference was found in the right IFG in either the whole-brain analysis or region-of-interest analysis. These findings imply that the neural deficits in tonal language speakers might differ from those in non-tonal language speakers, and overlap partly with the neural circuitries of lexical tone processing (e.g. right STG).												26	28											MAR	2017	97						18	28		10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.01.033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.01.033												2026-01-16	WOS:000397697000003

Four groups of listeners were examined: native Mandarin listeners, English-Mandarin bilinguals, Norwegian listeners with experience with Norwegian tone, and American listeners with no tone experience. Tone pairs were dichotically presented and listeners identified which tone they heard in each ear. For the Mandarin listeners, 57% of the total errors occurred in the left ear, indicating a right-ear (left-hemisphere) advantage. The English-Mandarin bilinguals exhibited nativelike patterns, with 56% left-car errors. However, no ear advantage was found for the Norwegian or American listeners (48 and 47% left-ear errors, respectively). Results indicate left-hemisphere dominance of Mandarin tone by native and proficient bilingual listeners, whereas normative listeners show no evidence of lateralization, regardless of their familiarity with lexical tone.												51	71											JUL	2004	25	3					449	466		10.1017/S0142716404001213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0142716404001213												2026-01-16	WOS:000222466200007

Event-related potentials to standard and deviant auditory stimuli were recorded as participants watched a silent movie attentively. The standards and deviants differed in either pitch level or pitch contour. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a were elicited by all types of deviant tones, suggesting that lexical tone was processed pre-attentively. In addition, the size and latency of MMN were sensitive to the size of pitch level change, while the latency of P3a captured the presence of pitch contour change. These results indicate that pitch contour and pitch height are two important dimensions in sensory processing of lexical tones. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study examined how emotions affect the acoustics and perception of Mandarin tones. In Experiment 1, Mandarin tones were produced by professional actors with angry, fear, happy, sad, and neutral tones of voice. Acoustic analyses on mean F0, F0 range, mean amplitude, and duration were conducted on syllables excised from a carrier phrase. The results showed that emotions affect Mandarin tone acoustics to different degrees depending on specific Mandarin tones and specific emotions. In Experiment 2, selected syllables from Experiment 1 were presented in isolation or in context. Listeners were asked to identify the Mandarin tones and emotions of the syllables. The results showed that emotions affect Mandarin tone identification to a greater extent than Mandarin tones affect emotion recognition. Both Mandarin tones and emotions were identified more accurately in syllables presented with the carrier phrase, but the carrier phrase affected Mandarin tone identification and emotion recognition to different degrees. These findings suggest that lexical tones and emotions interact in complex but systematic ways.												11	11											APR 5	2023	18	4							e0283635	10.1371/journal.pone.0283635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283635												2026-01-16	WOS:000967987200040
J	Ling, WY; Grüter, T				Ling, Wenyi; Gruter, Theres			From sounds to words: The relation between phonological and lexical processing of tone in L2 Mandarin	SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH				Article								Successful listening in a second language (L2) involves learning to identify the relevant acoustic-phonetic dimensions that differentiate between words in the L2, and then use these cues to access lexical representations during real-time comprehension. This is a particularly challenging goal to achieve when the relevant acoustic-phonetic dimensions in the L2 differ from those in the L1, as is the case for the L2 acquisition of Mandarin, a tonal language, by speakers of non-tonal languages like English. Previous work shows tone in L2 is perceived less categorically (Shen and Froud, 2019) and weighted less in word recognition (Pelzl et al., 2019) than in L1. However, little is known about the link between categorical perception of tone and use of tone in real time L2 word recognition at the level of the individual learner. This study presents evidence from 30 native and 29 L1-English speakers of Mandarin who completed a real-time spoken word recognition and a tone identification task. Results show that L2 learners differed from native speakers in both the extent to which they perceived tone categorically as well as in their ability to use tonal cues to distinguish between words in real-time comprehension. Critically, learners who reliably distinguished between words differing by tone alone in the word recognition task also showed more categorical perception of tone on the identification task. Moreover, within this group, performance on the two tasks was strongly correlated. This provides the first direct evidence showing that the ability to perceive tone categorically is related to the weighting of tonal cues during spoken word recognition, thus contributing to a better understanding of the link between phonemic and lexical processing, which has been argued to be a key component in the L2 acquisition of tone (Wong and Perrachione, 2007).												19	21											APR	2022	38	2					289	313	0267658320941546	10.1177/0267658320941546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0267658320941546		JUL 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000550722400001
J	Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO				Liu, Min; Chen, Yiya; Schiller, Niels O.			Context Matters for Tone and Intonation Processing in Mandarin	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								In tonal languages such as Mandarin, both lexical tone and sentence intonation are primarily signaled by F0. Their F0 encodings are sometimes in conflict and sometimes in congruency. The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that top-down information provided by the semantically constraining context can play a facilitating role for listeners to disentangle intonational information from tonal information, but mainly in sentences with the lexical falling tone in the final position.												6	6											MAR	2022	65	1					52	72	0023830920986174	10.1177/0023830920986174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830920986174		JAN 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000618452600001

Acoustic analysis of lexical tone in Mandarin infant-directed speech	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Using Mandarin Chinese, a "tone language" in which the pitch contours of syllables differentiate words, the authors examined the acoustic modifications of infant-directed speech (IDS) at the syllable level to test 2 hypotheses: (a) the overall increase in pitch and intonation contour that occurs in IDS at the phrase level would not distort lexical pitch at the syllable level and (b) IDS provides exaggerates cues to lexical tones. Sixteen Mandarin-speaking mothers were recorded while addressing their infants and addressing an adult. The results indicate that IDS does not distort the acoustic cues that are essential to word meaning at the syllable level; evidence of exaggeration of the acoustic differences in IDS was observed, extending previous findings of phonetic exaggeration to the lexical level.												64	85											JUL	2007	43	4					912	917		10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.912												2026-01-16	WOS:000247839400009
J	Wiener, S; Bradley, ED				Wiener, Seth; Bradley, Evan D.			Harnessing the musician advantage: Short-term musical training affects non-native cue weighting of linguistic pitch	LANGUAGE TEACHING RESEARCH				Article								Lexical tone languages like Mandarin Chinese require listeners to discriminate among different pitch patterns. A syllable spoken with a rising pitch (e.g. bi 'nose') carries a different meaning than the same syllable spoken with a falling pitch (e.g. b 'arm'). For native speakers (L1) of a non-tonal language, accurate perception of tones in a second language (L2) is notoriously difficult. Musicians, however, have typically shown an aptitude for lexical tone learning due to the unique perceptual demands of music. This study tested whether musical effects can be exploited to improve linguistic abilities in the general population. A pre-test, 8-week training, post-test design was used to measure L1 English participants' sensitivity to tone. Individual Differences Scaling was used to measure participants' weighting of pitch height and movement cues. Participants took part in classroom Mandarin learning only (+L2), musical ear training only (+Music), or classroom learning combined with musical training (+L2+Music). An L1 Mandarin group served as a baseline. At pre-test, mean sensitivity to tone and multidimensional scaling results were similar across all three L1 English groups. After training, all three L1 English groups improved in mean sensitivity, though only the +L2+Music group did so at a significant rate. Multidimensional scaling revealed that all groups increased their weighting of the more informative pitch movement cue at roughly equal rates. Short-term musical training thus affected change in cue weighting of linguistic pitch in a manner comparable to that occurring after a semester of L2 classroom learning. When combined with classroom learning, short-term musical training resulted in even greater sensitivity to pitch movement cues. These results contribute to models of music-language interaction and suggest that focused application of non-linguistic acoustic training can improve phonetic perception in ways that are relevant to language learning.												16	17											JUL	2023	27	4					1016	1031	1362168820971791	10.1177/1362168820971791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1362168820971791		NOV 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000599555600001

This study attempted to pinpoint the impairment mechanism of speech processing in tonal language speakers with amusia. We designed a series of perception tasks aiming at selectively probing low-level pitch processing and relatively high-level phonological processing of lexical tones, with an aim to illuminate the deficiency mechanism underlying tone perception in amusia. Method: Sixteen Cantonese speaking amusics and 16 matched controls were tested on the effects of acoustic (talker/syllable) variations on the identification and discrimination of Cantonese tones in two conditions. In the low-variation condition, tones were always associated with the same talker or syllable; in the high-variation condition, tones were associated with either different talkers (with the syllable controlled) or different syllables (with the talker controlled). Results: Largely similar results were obtained in talker and syllable variation conditions. Amusics exhibited overall poorer performance than controls in tone identification. Although amusics also demonstrated poorer performance in tone discrimination, the group difference was more obvious in low-variation conditions, where more acoustic constancy was provided. Besides, controls exhibited a greater increase in discrimination sensitivity from high- to low-variation conditions, implying a stronger benefit of acoustic constancy. Conclusions: The findings suggested that amusics' lexical tone perception abilities, in terms of both low-level pitch processing and high-level phonological processing, as measured in low- and high-variation conditions, are impaired. Importantly, amusics were more impaired in taking advantage of low acoustic variation contexts and thus less efficiently sharpened their perception of tones when perceptual anchors in talker/syllable were provided, suggesting a possible "anchoring deficit" in congenital amusia.												14	14											JAN	2019	62	1					190	205		10.1044/2018_JSLHR-H-17-0483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-H-17-0483												2026-01-16	WOS:000458482300014

Thirty prelingually Mandarin-speaking preschoolers with CI+HA and 30 age-matched normal-hearing (NH) children participated in the study. Fourteen disyllabic words were recorded from each child. A total of 840 tokens (14 x 60) were then used in tone-perception tests in which four speech therapists participated. The production of T2-related disyllabic words of the bimodal group was significantly worse than that of the NH group, as reflected in the overall accuracy (88.57% +/- 16.31% vs 99.29% +/- 21.79%, p < 0.05), the accuracy of T1+T2 (93.33% vs 100%), the accuracy of T2+T1 (66.67 +/- 37.91% vs 98.33 +/- 9.13%), and the accuracy of T2+T4 (78.33 +/- 33.95% vs 100%). In addition, the bimodal group showed significantly inferior production accuracy of T2+T1 than T2+T2 and T3+T2, p < 0.05. Both bimodal age and implantation age were significantly negatively correlated with the overall production accuracy, p < 0.05. For the error patterns, bimodal participants experienced more errors when T2 was in the first position of the tone combination, and T2 was most likely to be mispronounced as T1 and T3. Bimodal patients aged 3-5 have T2-related disyllabic lexical tone production defects, and their performances are related to tone combination, implantation age, and bimodal age.												1	1											NOV 2	2023	37	11					1013	1029		10.1080/02699206.2022.2126332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2022.2126332		OCT 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000865664000001
J	Zhang, W; Clayards, M; Sonderegger, M				Zhang, Wei; Clayards, Meghan; Sonderegger, Morgan			Imitation of F0 tone contours by Mandarin and English speakers is both categorical and continuous	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Native speakers imitate F0 contours that vary between two lexical tones non-linearly-they do not precisely reproduce the presented F0 features but instead cluster them toward tonal categories, the so-called contrast mediation effect. However, less is known whether non-native speakers who lack the lexical tone phonology will show linear imitation of F0 contours. Addressing this question will deepen our understanding of whether F0 imitation is solely influenced by lexical tone contrasts or also shaped by other sources of non-linearity beyond phonological contrasts. To investigate this, the current study examined the categorization and imitation of a Mandarin flat-falling tonal continuum by both Mandarin speakers and English speakers who were na & iuml;ve to tonal languages. Imitation distributions were analyzed by comparing two models: a linear regression model, which assumes participants linearly track phonetic cues, and a mixture regression model, which assumes imitation reflects underlying categories. The mixture regression model fit the data better for the Mandarin speakers while the reverse was true for the English speakers, suggesting that Mandarin speakers imitated the F0 contours more categorically than English speakers. However, for both groups, the data was best fit using a weighted combination of both models. For the Mandarin group this result along with additional analyses of duration, F1 and intensity suggest that tone categories involve both phonological and phonetic information and imitation taps both, possibly via hyper- and hypo-articulation. For English participants, the evidence for categorical mediation suggests that imitation is mediated by factors other than lexically contrastive linguistic categories, although the exact nature of the factors is unclear.												0	0											NOV	2025	113								101457	10.1016/j.wocn.2025.101457009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2025.101457009												2026-01-16	WOS:001614049200001

Study Design: A controlled study with six experimental conditions. Methods: Seven Mandarin-speaking listeners who received a MED-EL cochlear implant (CI), ranging in age from 12.88 to 36.43 years (mean, 25.51 years), with an average of 5.28 years of device experience, participated this study. To evaluate the effects of electrode location, six experimental conditions each with the switch off at six different electrodes were designed. Identification tests of Mandarin lexical tones and words were performed. Results: Among experimental conditions with electrode lengths of 31, 23.8, and 16.6 mm, the CI subjects exhibited improved vowel and consonant identification in the condition of 31 mm, reflecting the apical location of electrodes. Specifically, the improvement was observed in the identification score for the vowel backness and height, as well as for the consonant place of articulation. Comparison among three settings with a same electrode length of 12.6 mm and the setting with stimulation to the midregion of the cochlea produces better words as well as the vowel and consonant identification compared with stimulation to basal and apical regions. However, no significant difference was observed for the lexical tone identification among conditions with different electrode location and stimulating region. Conclusions: Less mismatch of the frequency-to-place alignment may account for the improvement of word identification in conditions with electrodes coverage to more apical location; and in conditions where the mid-region of the cochlea were stimulated.

Sixteen children with ASD (mean age = 10.42 years, SD = 2.12 years) and sixteen normal controls (mean age = 9.48 years, SD = .86 years) participated in two experiments, in which Cantonese lexical tone contrasts and non-speech pitch variations were presented to children following an oddball paradigm when they watched a silent movie. The results showed that: 1) When processing speech pitch contour, the two groups did not differ in the amplitude of mismatch response (p-MMR), while typically developing controls showed larger mismatch negativity (MMN) responses than children with ASD. In the processing of speech pitch height, more positive p-MMR was observed among children with ASD than among normal controls and stronger MMN was found for typically developing children than for children with ASD. 2) For the processing of non-speech pitch, MMN rather than p-MMR was observed and the two groups did not differ significantly with each other in the amplitudes of MMN. These results indicated that Cantonese-speaking children with ASD manifested impaired ability when processing speech pitch information (i.e., lexical tone), which was in line with previous research. However, they did not show the advantage in processing non-speech or auditory pitch information, which was not in agreement with the previous studies. Results were discussed from the perspective of how language background (i.e., Cantonese) might shape the perceptive abilities of children.												14	15											JUN 11	2019	703						205	212		10.1016/j.neulet.2019.03.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.03.021												2026-01-16	WOS:000470342000032

A Comparison of Monolingual and Bilingual Infants' Abilities to Integrate Lexical Tone in Novel Word Learning	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								To construct their first lexicon, infants must determine the relationship between native phonological variation and the meanings of words. This process is arguably more complex for bilingual learners who are often confronted with phonological conflict: phonological variation that is lexically relevant in one language may be lexically irrelevant in the other. In a series of four experiments, the present study investigated English Mandarin bilingual infants' abilities to negotiate phonological conflict introduced by learning both a tone and a non-tone language. In a novel word learning task, bilingual children were tested on their sensitivity to tone variation in English and Mandarin contexts. Their abilities to interpret tone variation in a language-dependent manner were compared to those of monolingual Mandarin learning infants. Results demonstrated that at 12-13 months, bilingual infants demonstrated the ability to bind tone to word meanings in Mandarin, but to disregard tone variation when learning new words in English. In contrast, monolingual learners of Mandarin did not show evidence of integrating tones into word meanings in Mandarin at the same age even though they were learning a tone language. However, a tone discrimination paradigm confirmed that monolingual Mandarin learning infants were able to tell these tones apart at 12-13 months under a different set of conditions. Later, at 17-18 months, monolingual Mandarin learners were able to bind tone variation to word meanings when learning new words. Our findings are discussed in terms of cognitive adaptations associated with bilingualism that may ease the negotiation of phonological conflict and facilitate precocious uptake of certain properties of each language.												28	32											MAY 10	2016	7								667	10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00667	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00667												2026-01-16	WOS:000375391300001
J	Meng, QL; Zheng, NH; Li, X				Meng, Qinglin; Zheng, Nengheng; Li, Xia			Loudness Contour Can Influence Mandarin Tone Recognition: Vocoder Simulation and Cochlear Implants	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING				Article								Lexical tone recognition with current cochlear implants (CI) remains unsatisfactory due to significantly degraded pitch-related acoustic cues, which dominate the tone recognition by normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Several secondary cues (e.g., amplitude contour, duration, and spectral envelope) that influence tone recognition in NH listeners and CI users have been studied. This work proposes a loudness contour manipulation algorithm, namely Loudness-Tone (L-Tone), to investigate the effects of loudness contour on Mandarin tone recognition and the effectiveness of using loudness cue to enhance tone recognition for CI users. With L-Tone, the intensity of sound samples is multiplied by gain values determined by instantaneous fundamental frequencies (F0s) and pre-defined gain-F0 mapping functions. Perceptual experiments were conducted with a four-channel noise-band vocoder simulation in NH listeners and with CI users. The results suggested that 1) loudness contour is a useful secondary cue for Mandarin tone recognition, especially when pitch cues are significantly degraded; 2) L-Tone can be used to improve Mandarin tone recognition in both simulated and actual CI-hearing without significant negative effect on vowel and consonant recognition. L-Tone is a promising algorithm for incorporation into real-time CI processing and off-line CI rehabilitation training software.												12	13											JUN	2017	25	6					641	649		10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2593489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2593489												2026-01-16	WOS:000404275500014

Lizu has been argued to have a hybrid prosodic system combining lexical tone on monosyllabic words and prominence patterns with stress-like and tonal characteristics on polysyllabic words, although empirical evidence is lacking. This study presents an acoustic investigation of the pitch patterns on disyllabic words in the Kala variety of Lizu (HL, HH, LH). Using the parameters of duration, intensity, and f0, it attempts to sort out different forms of prominence, and to explore their interaction with lexical tone. The measurements are taken from experimental data with eight Lizu speakers (4 male and 4 female). The acoustic results and statistical analyses suggest that the first syllable in Kala Lizu is the position of prominence in all three pitch patterns. Our results are consistent with interpreting the pitch pattern HL as more stress-like (with intensity as an acoustic correlate of stress) and the pitch patterns HH and LH as more tone -like (with stress cued by full realization of lexical tone). This study contributes to a better understanding of the prosodic organization of Kala Lizu and it also suggests methodology for further exploration of other Lizu varieties.												0	0											JAN	2023	51	1					101	146		10.1353/jcl.2023.0008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2023.0008												2026-01-16	WOS:000937271600006
J	Laméris, TJ; Post, B				Lameris, Tim Joris; Post, Brechtje			The combined effects of L1-specific and extralinguistic factors on individual performance in a tone categorization and word identification task by English-L1 and Mandarin-L1 speakers	SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH				Article								Adult second language learners often show considerable individual variability in the ease with which lexical tones are learned. It is known that factors pertaining to a learner's first language (L1; such as L1 tonal status or L1 tone type) as well as extralinguistic factors (such as musical experience and working memory) modulate tone learning facility. However, how such L1-specific and extralinguistic factors affect performance together in dynamic ways is less well understood. Therefore, to unpack the potential interactions between these factors for individual learners, we assessed the combined effects of L1 tonal status, L1 tone type, and musical experience and working memory on second language (L2) tone perception and word learning in a tonal pseudolanguage by English-L1 and Mandarin-L1 adult learners, by using a pre-lexical tone categorization task and a lexical word identification task. We found that L2 tone perception and word learning were primarily facilitated by extralinguistic factors, but that the degree to which learners rely on these factors is modulated by their L1 tonal status, as for instance musical experience facilitated perception and word learning for English, but not for Mandarin participants. We also found clear effects of L1 tone type, as Mandarin participants tended to struggle with categorizing and lexically processing level tone contrasts, which do not occur in Mandarin.												15	15											JUL	2023	39	3					833	871	02676583221090068	10.1177/02676583221090068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02676583221090068		APR 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000789391400001

We investigated developmental changes in infant interpretation of sounds that aid in object mapping. Dutch monolingual and bilingual (exposed to Dutch and a second non-tone-language) infants' word learning ability was examined on two novel label-object pairings using syllables differing in Mandarin tones as labels (flat vs. falling). Infants aged 14-15 months, regardless of language backgrounds, were sensitive to violations in the label-objects pairings when lexical tones were switched compared to when they were the same as habituated. Conversely at 17-18 months, neither monolingual nor bilingual infants demonstrated learning. Linking with existing literature, infants' ability to associate non-native tones with meanings may be related to tonal acoustic properties and/or perceptual assimilation to native prosodic categories. These findings provide new insights into the relation between infant tone perception, learning, and interpretative narrowing from a developmental perspective.												26	29											MAR 15	2018	9								117	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00117	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00117												2026-01-16	WOS:000427535100001
J	Chang, CY; Hsieh, FF				Chang, Chiung-Yu; Hsieh, Feng-fan			Do subsyllabic units play a role in Mandarin spoken word recognition? Evidence from phonotactic processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS				Article								This study investigates the roles of Mandarin subsyllabic units in spoken word recognition by examining the neural processing of two phonotactic anomalies: (1) segmental gaps, which contain a non-existing combination of segments (e.g., *[ki1]); and (2) tonal gaps, which refer to a nonword comprised of possible segment combinations with an incongruous tone (e.g., *[tau2]; cf. [tau1] "knife"). Event-related potentials were recorded while participants performed an auditory lexical decision task. The response to segmental gaps differed from the other stimuli types in the amplitudes and scalp distributions of several components, including the P350, the N400, and the late positive complex. The P350 effect occurred around 370 ms before the entire syllable was revealed, indicating that lexical processing is not based solely on syllable representations. Furthermore, the overall differences between segmental and tonal gaps suggest that tones and vowels are dissociable. These results thus provide converging evidence for the view that Mandarin syllables are processed incrementally through phonemes.												2	2											NOV	2022	64								101089	10.1016/j.jneuroling.2022.101089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroling.2022.101089		JUN 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000810177300001
J	Feng, Y; Peng, G; Wang, WSY				Feng, Yan; Peng, Gang; Wang, William Shi-Yuan			Categorical Perception of Lexical Tones in Mandarin-Speaking Seniors	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: This study aims to investigate the different degeneration processes of categorical perception (CP) of Mandarin lexical tones in the normal aging popu-lation and the pathological aging population with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).Method: In Experiment I, we compared the identification and discrimination of Tone 1 and Tone 2 across young adults, seniors aged 60-65 years, and older seniors aged 75-80 years with normal cognitive abilities. In Experiment II, we compared lexical tone identification and discrimination across young adults, healthy seniors, and age-matched seniors with MCI.Results: In Experiment I, tone perception was intact in seniors aged below 65 years. Those aged above 75 years could also maintain normal tone identifi-cation, whereas they showed poorer tone discrimination correlated with age -related poorer hearing level. In Experiment II, healthy seniors showed normal CP of Mandarin tones. Tone identification was also normal in those with MCI, whereas their tone discrimination had significantly degenerated.Conclusions: In the normal aging population, age-related hearing loss decreased signal audibility, accounting for poorer discrimination of Mandarin lexical tones in seniors above 75 years. In the pathological aging population with MCI, the poorer discrimination of lexical tones may be attributed to the additive effect of age, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment (e.g., impaired working memory and long-term phonological memory). This study uncovered the roles of low-level sensory processing and high-level cognitive processing in lexical tone perception in the Chinese aging population.												6	6											AUG	2022	65	8					2789	2800		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-21-00584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-21-00584												2026-01-16	WOS:000843885000005

Phonological and phonetic contributions to perception of non-native lexical tones by tone language listeners: Effects of memory load and stimulus variability	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								The present study examined native language phonological and phonetic factors in non-native lexical tone percep-tion by tone language listeners, manipulating memory load and stimulus variability to bias listeners towards a more phonological or more phonetic mode of perception. Mandarin and Vietnamese listeners categorised the five Thai lexical tones to their native tones, and discriminated five selected Thai tone contrasts that were predicted by the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM, Best, 1995) to be discriminated differently. Categorisation responses showed more phonologically-based patterns under high than low memory load but were unaffected by talker and vowel variability, whereas discrimination accuracy was reduced by talker and vowel variability but not by mem-ory load. Phonological factors indicated by type of categorisation and category overlap generally predicted the dis-crimination of non-native tone contrasts in line with PAM principles. Phonetic factors reflected in category overlap scores and fit index difference scores predicted variations in discriminating contrasts of the same contrast cate-gorisation type. These findings uphold the extension of PAM principles to non-native tone perception by native lis-teners of other tone languages. Native phonological and phonetic contributions to non-native speech perception differ between categorisation and discrimination tasks, as reflected in differential modulation by memory load and stimulus variability.CO 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wong, P; Cheng, ST; Chen, F				Wong, Puisan; Cheng, Sheung Ting; Chen, Fei			Cantonese Tone Identification in Three Temporal Cues in Quiet, Speech-Shaped Noise and Two-Talker Babble	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Purpose: Cochlear implant processors deliver mostly temporal envelope information and limited fundamental frequency (F0) information to the users, which make pitch and lexical tone perception challenging for cochlear implantees. Different factors have been found to affect Mandarin tone perception in temporal cues but the most effective temporal cues for lexical tone identification across different backgrounds remained unclear because no study has comprehensively examined the effects and interactions of these factors, particularly, in languages that use both pitch heights and pitch shapes to differentiate lexical meanings. The present study compared identification of Cantonese tones in naturally produced stimuli, and in three temporal cues, namely the amplitude contour cue (TE50), the periodicity cue (TE500), and the temporal fine structure cue (TFS), in three different numbers of frequency bands (B04, B08, B16) in quiet and two types of noise (two male talker-babble and speech-shaped noise). Method: Naturally produced Cantonese tones and synthetic tones that combined different acoustic cues and different number of frequency bands were presented to 18 young native Cantonese speakers for tone identification in quiet and noise. Results: Among the three temporal cues, TFS was the most effective for Cantonese tone identification in quiet and noise, except for T4 (LF) identification. Its effect was even stronger when the tones were presented in 4 or 8 bands rather than 16 bands. Neither TE500 nor TE50 was effective for Cantonese tone identification in quiet or noise. In noise, most tones in TE500 and TE50 were misheard as T4 (LF), demonstrating errors in both tone shapes and tone heights. Types of noise had limited effect on tone identification. Conclusions: Findings on Mandarin tone perception in temporal cues may not be applicable to other tone languages with more complex tonal systems. TFS presented in four bands was the most effective temporal cue for Cantonese tone identification in quiet and noise. Temporal envelope cues were not effective for tone, tone shape or tone height identification in Cantonese. These findings have implications for future design of cochlear implants for tone speakers who use pitch heights or a combination of pitch heights and pitch shapes to differentiate meanings.												6	6											OCT 9	2018	9								1604	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01604	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01604												2026-01-16	WOS:000446869300001

A crucial question is whether such early representations are maintained in the brain over time without continued input. Using functional MRI, we show that internationally adopted (IA) children from China, exposed exclusively to French since adoption (mean age of adoption, 12.8 mo), maintained neural representations of their birth language despite functionally losing that language and having no conscious recollection of it. Their neural patterns during a Chinese lexical tone discrimination task matched those observed in Chinese/French bilinguals who have had continual exposure to Chinese since birth and differed from monolingual French speakers who had never been exposed to Chinese. They processed lexical tone as linguistically relevant, despite having no Chinese exposure for 12.6 y, on average, and no conscious recollection of that language. More specifically, IA participants recruited left superior temporal gyrus/planum temporale, matching the pattern observed in Chinese/French bilinguals. In contrast, French speakers who had never been exposed to Chinese did not recruit this region and instead activated right superior temporal gyrus. We show that neural representations are not overwritten and suggest a special status for language input obtained during the first year of development.												81	97											DEC 2	2014	111	48					17314	17319		10.1073/pnas.1409411111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1409411111												2026-01-16	WOS:000345920800074

Design Language experience was evaluated using two groups, Mandarin- vs. English-listeners (with vs. without lexical tone experience). Two Mandarin lexical tones with pitch movement (T2 rising; T3 dipping) produced on the syllable /ba/ were used as stimuli. For passive listening, each tone was presented in a block. For active listening, each tone was the standard (80%) or deviant (20%) presented in two blocks. Presentation order was counterbalanced across participants in both tasks. Study sample 10 adult Mandarin-listeners and 13 Australian-English-listeners contributed to the data. Results Both global field power (GFP) and time frequency analysis (TFA) failed to detect group differences in passive listening conditions for the ACC response. In contrast, the active listening condition revealed significant group differences for T2. GFP showed a trending significance with larger GFP (less consistent responses) in English- than Mandarin-listeners. TFA showed significantly higher alpha synchronisation (more focussed attention) for Mandarin- compared to English-listeners. Conclusions Acoustic responses to speech is influenced by language experience but only during active listening, suggesting that focussed attention is linked to higher level language processes.												1	1											JUN 1	2022	61	6					490	499		10.1080/14992027.2021.1941326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2021.1941326		JUL 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000670830800001

People with amusia have been found to be impaired on linguistic tasks; we examined whether absolute pitch (AP) possessors have an advantage on linguistic tasks. Participants were 3 groups of monolingual Australian-English speakers: non-AP musicians (musically-trained individuals who did not possess AP), AP musicians (musically-trained individuals who were AP possessors), and non-musicians (no musical training). Perceptual discrimination was tested in an AX same-different task for lexical tones presented in three contexts: normal Thai speech, low-pass filtered speech tones, and violin, with processing level manipulated via variation of the interstimulus interval (ISI). Non-musicians showed attenuated pitch discrimination of tones in speech, suggesting speech specialisation. On the other hand, all musicians showed greater accuracy, faster reaction times and less variation in accuracy across stimulus types than non-musicians. Importantly, AP musicians showed greater accuracy than non-AP musicians in the speech context, implying a domain-general advantage due to AP. However, speech-violin accuracy correlations for AP musicians were almost zero at the longer ISI, suggesting less commonality of mechanisms during more extensive processing. Results are discussed in terms of the role of AP in tone language perception.												34	41											NOV	2015	43	6					881	897		10.1177/0305735614546359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0305735614546359												2026-01-16	WOS:000363279700009
J	Shang, N; Styles, SJ				Shang, Nan; Styles, Suzy J.			Implicit Association Test (IAT) Studies Investigating Pitch-Shape Audiovisual Cross-modal Associations Across Language Groups	COGNITIVE SCIENCE				Article								Previous studies have shown that Chinese speakers and non-Chinese speakers exhibit different patterns of cross-modal congruence for the lexical tones of Mandarin Chinese, depending on which features of the pitch they attend to. But is this pattern of language-specific listening a conscious cultural strategy or an automatic processing effect? If automatic, does it also apply when the same pitch contours no longer sound like speech? Implicit Association Tests (IATs) provide an indirect measure of cross-modal association. In a series of IAT studies, conducted with participants with three kinds of language backgrounds (Chinese-dominant bilinguals, Chinese balanced bilinguals, and English speakers with no Chinese experience) we find language-specific congruence effects for Mandarin lexical tones but not for matched sine-wave stimuli. That is, for linguistic stimuli, non-Chinese speakers show advantages for pitch-height congruence (high-pointy, low-curvy); no congruence effects were found for Chinese speakers. For non-linguistic stimuli, all participant groups showed advantages for pitch-height congruence. The present findings suggest that non-lexical tone congruence (high-pointy, low-curvy) is a basic congruence pattern, and the acquisition of a language with lexical tone can alter this perception.												4	4											JAN	2023	47	1							e13221	10.1111/cogs.13221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.13221												2026-01-16	WOS:000908037200001
J	Zhou, N; Xu, L				Zhou, Ning; Xu, Li			Lexical tone recognition with spectrally mismatched envelopes	HEARING RESEARCH				Article								It has been shown that frequency-place mismatch has detrimental effects on English speech recognition. The present study investigated the effects of mismatched spectral distribution of envelopes on Mandarin Chinese tone recognition using a noise-excited vocoder. In Experiment 1, speech samples were processed to simulate a cochlear implant with various insertion depths. The carrier bands were shifted basally relative to the analysis bands by 1-7 mm in the cochlea. Nine normal-hearing Mandarin Chinese listeners participated in this experiment. Basal shift of the carriers only slightly affected tone recognition. The resistance of tone recognition to spectral shift can be attributed to the overall amplitude contour cues that are independent from spectral manipulations. Experiment 2 examined the effects of frequency compression, where widened analysis bands by 2, 6, and 10 mm were compressively allocated to narrower carrier bands. Five of the 9 subjects participated in Experiment 2. It appears that the expanded frequency information especially on the low frequency end can compensate for the distortion from frequency compression. Thus, spectral shift might not pose a severe problem for tone recognition, and allocation of wider frequency range to include more low frequency information might be beneficial for tone recognition.

Twenty-three Cantonese-speaking amusics and 23 controls were tested on the identification of high-variation tone stimuli in isolation vs in a carrier sentence. The controls generally achieved a higher accuracy with context than in isolation, suggesting that speech context facilitated tone identification. In contrast, amusics generally failed to benefit from the context, despite some variation among different tones. These findings provide insights into the underlying deficits of amusia, revealing a context integration deficit of tone perception in amusia.

J	Ota, M; Yamane, N; Mazuka, R				Ota, Mitsuhiko; Yamane, Naoto; Mazuka, Reiko			The Effects of Lexical Pitch Accent on Infant Word Recognition in Japanese	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Learners of lexical tone languages (e.g., Mandarin) develop sensitivity to tonal contrasts and recognize pitch-matched, but not pitch-mismatched, familiar words by 11 months. Learners of non-tone languages (e.g., English) also show a tendency to treat pitch patterns as lexically contrastive up to about 18 months. In this study, we examined if this early-developing capacity to lexically encode pitch variations enables infants to acquire a pitch accent system, in which pitch-based lexical contrasts are obscured by the interaction of lexical and non-lexical (i.e., intonational) features. Eighteen 17-month-olds learning Tokyo Japanese were tested on their recognition of familiar words with the expected pitch or the lexically opposite pitch pattern. In early trials, infants were faster in shifting their eyegaze from the distractor object to the target object than in shifting from the target to distractor in the pitch-matched condition. In later trials, however, infants showed faster distractor-to-target than target-to-distractor shifts in both the pitch-matched and pitch-mismatched conditions. We interpret these results to mean that, in a pitch-accent system, the ability to use pitch variations to recognize words is still in a nascent state at 17 months.												4	4											JAN 12	2018	8								2354	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02354	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02354												2026-01-16	WOS:000419922400001
J	Ning, LH; Loucks, TM; Shih, C				Ning, Li-Hsin; Loucks, Torrey M.; Shih, Chilin			The effects of language learning and vocal training on sensorimotor control of lexical tone	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								To perceive and produce Mandarin, adult second language (L2) learners need to learn to discriminate lexical pitch variations and develop the new sensorimotor skills needed to produce the lexical tones. In this paper, we investigated whether auditory discrimination and sensorimotor integration differ with Mandarin (tonal) language experience in the context of tonal language syllables and simple sustained vowels. We tested four distinct groups: native Mandarin speakers, Mandarin L2 adults, trained vocalists, and naive adults (those with no tonal language exposure). Auditory discrimination was measured using two perceptual tasks, musical tone discrimination and Mandarin tone discrimination, the results of which were compared across the four groups. Group differences in sensorimotor integration related to lexical tone production were examined with a pitch-shift paradigm that assessed rapid motor responses to unexpected pitch perturbations. Mandarin speakers performed significantly better on Mandarin tone discrimination compared to the other three groups. Mandarin speakers also showed more attenuation of pitch-shift response amplitude (better vocal pitch control) during production of both the sustained vowel and Mandarin tones, especially compared to naive speakers. These findings suggest that Mandarin speakers have more robust pitch control over self-produced vocalizations and are thus less affected by auditory feedback perturbations. This effect was particularly evident in response to the Mandarin high level lexical tone, for which the pitch-shift compensation patterns (with apparent attenuation in Mandarin speakers only) differed qualitatively from those of sustained vowels (with clear compensation in all groups), the rising tone (with apparent attenuation in all groups but naive speakers), and the falling tone (with apparent attenuation in all groups). Trained vocalists also appear to rely more than naive speakers on internal models when regulating voice FO in the nonlinguistic domain (sustained vowel), but not in the linguistic domain (Mandarin tone). Native Mandarin speakers demonstrate robust internal models for lexical tone in both perception and production; this underscores the importance of developmental language experience but also provides evidence for the declination of the high level lexical tone which requires a mastery of tonal languages.

In this early efficacy study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) in facilitating speech and word output for Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism, in comparison with a matched non-AMMT-based control treatment. Method: Fifteen Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism spectrum disorder participated and completed all the AMMT-based treatment sessions by intoning (singing) and tapping the target words delivered via an app, whereas another 15 participants received control treatment. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to evaluate speech production accuracy and word production intelligibility across different groups and conditions. Results: Results showed that the AMMT-based treatment provided a more effective training approach in accelerating the rate of speech (especially lexical tone) and word learning in the trained items. More importantly, the enhanced training efficacy on lexical tone acquisition remained at 2 weeks after therapy and generalized to untrained tones that were not practiced. Furthermore, the low-verbal participants showed higher improvement compared to the nonverbal participants. Conclusions: These data provide the first empirical evidence for adopting the AMMT-based training to facilitate speech and word learning in Mandarin-speaking nonverbal and low-verbal children with autism. This early efficacy study holds promise for improving lexical tone production in Mandarin-speaking children with autism but should be further replicated in larger scale randomized studies.

Although previous studies showed statistically significant differences in F0 between a high-rising Sandhi-Tone3 (T3) and a Tone2, native Mandarin listeners failed to correctly categorize these two tones in perception tasks. The current study utilized the visual-world paradigm in eye-tracking to further examine whether acoustic details in lexical tone aid lexical access in Mandarin. Results showed that Mandarin listeners tend to process Tone2 as Tone2 whereas they tend to first process Sandhi-T3 as both Tone3 and Tone2, then later detect the acoustic differences between the two tones revealed by the sandhi context, and finally activate the target word during lexical access. The eye-tracking results suggest that subtle acoustic details of F0 may facilitate lexical access in automatic fashion in a tone language.												4	4											FEB 7	2022	12								756921	10.3389/fpsyg.2021.756921	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.756921												2026-01-16	WOS:000760652000001

Cantonese tone recognition with enhanced temporal periodicity cues	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This study investigated the contributions of temporal periodicity cues and the effectiveness of enhancing these cues for Cantonese tone recognition in noise. A multichannel noise-excited vocoder was used to simulate speech processing in cochlear implants. Ten normal-hearing listeners were tested. Temporal envelope and periodicity cues (TEPCs) below 500 Hz were extracted from four frequency bands: 60-500, 500-1000, 1000-2000, and 2000-4000 Hz. The test stimuli were obtained by combining TEPC-modulated noise signals from individual bands. For periodicity enhancement, temporal fluctuations in the range 20-500 Hz were replaced by a sinusoid with frequency equal to the fundamental frequency of original speech. Tone identification experiments were carried out using disyllabic word carriers. Results showed that TEPCs from the two high-frequency bands were more important for tone identification than TEPCs from the low-frequency bands. The use of periodicity-enhanced TEPCs led to consistent improvement of tone identification accuracy. The improvement was more significant at low signal-to-noise ratios, and more noticeable for female than for male voices. Analysis of error distributions showed that the enhancement method reduced tone identification errors and did not show any negative effect on the recognition of segmental structures.												18	23											JUL	2009	126	1					327	337		10.1121/1.3117447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.3117447												2026-01-16	WOS:000268065100043

Lexical Tone Perception Ability of Profoundly Hearing-Impaired Children: Performance of Cochlear Implant and Hearing Aid Users	OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY				Article								Objective: In tone languages such as Cantonese, a change in tone denotes a change in lexical meaning. The present study investigates the functional benefit of hearing devices in assisting tone perception among children with profound hearing impairment. Subjects: Fifty-two children with profound hearing loss were categorized into two groups based on their primary type of hearing device - a hearing aid group and cochlear implant group. Methods: A 75-item tone identification test covering all 15 Cantonese tone contrast pairs was administered to each subject under two conditions unaided (hearing devices turned off) and aided (devices turned on). The proportion of correct responses was computed as the total score for all items and subtotal contrast scores for each of the 15 tone contrasts. Results: The results indicated no significant differences between the children wearing hearing aids and those with cochlear implants under the unaided or the aided condition (z = 0.91, p = 0.36; z = -0.40, p = 0.69, respectively). Regardless of the type of device used, the total scores under the aided condition were higher than those under the unaided condition (z = -3.55 for the hearing aid group; z = -4.87 for the cochlear implant group, both ps <0.01). Conclusion: Children wearing hearing devices generally have a satisfactory functional gain in tone perception. No major observable difference was noted between children using cochlear implants and those using hearing aids. Tone contrast pairs with dissimilar fundamental frequency at onset and dissimilar tone contour patterns were more easily identified.												17	20											SEP	2010	31	7					1079	1087		10.1097/MAO.0b013e3181eb3242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0b013e3181eb3242												2026-01-16	WOS:000281603200010

However, whether this intelligence is deficient in children with cochlear implants (CIs) remains unclear. Methods: Mandarin Chinese monosyllables shared a flat lexical tone contour to form an abstract auditory rule but differed in other acoustic features to construct a complex speech sound stream. The abstract rule was occasionally violated by monosyllables with a rising or falling lexical tone. Results: In normal hearing (NH) children, the abstract auditory rule could be extracted, as revealed by a mismatch negativity (MMN) and a late discriminative negativity (LDN). However, the MMN and LDN were only evoked in CI children with good hearing and speech performance. NH children with a higher speech perception or spatial hearing score had a greater MMN. The LDN was attenuated with increasing age in NH children. Conclusions: The sensory intelligence for extraction of auditory abstract rules, associated with speech perception, is deficient in CI children. This intelligence may gradually develop during childhood and adolescence. Significance: Deficient sensory intelligence in CI children may aid in understanding poor speech comprehension in complex environments. (c) 2024 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Adding low-frequency acoustic hearing via a hearing aid in the contralateral ear may improve CI users' F0 perception. For English-speaking CI users, contralateral acoustic hearing has been shown to improve perception of target speech in noise and in competing talkers. For tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese, F0 information is lexically meaningful. Given competing F0 information from multiple talkers and lexical tones, contralateral acoustic hearing may be especially beneficial for Mandarin-speaking CI users' perception of competing speech. Design: Bimodal benefit (CI+hearing aid - CI-only) was evaluated in 11 pediatric Mandarin-speaking Chinese CI users. In experiment 1, speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were adaptively measured using a modified coordinated response measure test; subjects were required to correctly identify 2 keywords from among 10 choices in each category. SRTs were measured with CI-only or bimodal listening in the presence of steady state noise (SSN) or competing speech with the same (M+M) or different voice gender (M+F). Unaided thresholds in the non-CI ear and demographic factors were compared with speech performance. In experiment 2, SRTs were adaptively measured in SSN for recognition of 5 keywords, a more difficult listening task than the 2-keyword recognition task in experiment 1. Results: In experiment 1, SRTs were significantly lower for SSN than for competing speech in both the CI-only and bimodal listening conditions. There was no significant difference between CI-only and bimodal listening for SSN and M+F (p > 0.05); SRTs were significantly lower for CI-only than for bimodal listening for M+M (p < 0.05), suggesting bimodal interference. Subjects were able to make use of voice gender differences for bimodal listening (p < 0.05) but not for CI-only listening (p > 0.05). Unaided thresholds in the non-CI ear were positively correlated with bimodal SRTs for M+M (p < 0.006) but not for SSN or M+F. No significant correlations were observed between any demographic variables and SRTs (p > 0.05 in all cases). In experiment 2, SRTs were significantly lower with two than with five keywords (p < 0.05). A significant bimodal benefit was observed only for the 5-keyword condition (p < 0.05). Conclusions: With the CI alone, subjects experienced greater interference with competing speech than with SSN and were unable to use voice gender difference to segregate talkers. For the coordinated response measure task, subjects experienced no bimodal benefit and even bimodal interference when competing talkers were the same voice gender. A bimodal benefit in SSN was observed for the five-keyword condition but not for the two-keyword condition, suggesting that bimodal listening may be more beneficial as the difficulty of the listening task increased. The present data suggest that bimodal benefit may depend on the type of masker and/or the difficulty of the listening task.												22	24											NOV-DEC	2019	40	6					1316	1327		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000712												2026-01-16	WOS:000494721600006

However, there is limited understanding regarding their integration of contextual cues in speech processing. This study aims to explore how Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD identify lexical tones in speech and nonspeech contexts, and to determine whether the size of context effect would be modulated by children's cognitive abilities. Twenty-five children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) children were asked to identify Mandarin lexical tones preceded by three types of contexts (speech, nonspeech, and nonspeech-flattened contexts). We also tested child participants' verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory capacity. Results revealed that the context effect was only observed in the speech contexts, where Mandarin-speaking children with ASD exhibited a reduced context effect compared to TD children. Moreover, TD children with higher verbal intelligence demonstrated a diminished context effect. However, nonverbal intelligence and working memory capacity were not significantly associated with the size of context effect in either group. These findings revealed a subtle yet important difference between ASD and TD children's utilization of speech contexts in lexical tone identification, and validated a speech-specific mechanism underpinning children's lexical tone normalization.												0	0											2025 MAR 7	2025										10.1007/s10803-025-06775-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10803-025-06775-2		MAR 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001438996300001

EARLY CORTICAL PROCESSING OF LINGUISTIC PITCH PATTERNS AS REVEALED BY THE MISMATCH NEGATIVITY	NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Previous brain imaging studies have shown the left hemispheric dominance for processing of lexical tone in native speakers. However, the low temporal resolution related to neuroimaging techniques might not explicitly detect the brain activities that occur at a relatively small or a determined time frame. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and a source estimation technique (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) to probe the brain activities underlying the early pre-attentive processing of Mandarin lexical tone and intonation. A passive oddball paradigm was applied to present tone and intonation contrast in a speech and nonspeech context. The results showed that no difference of the MMN amplitudes existed between speech and nonspeech conditions, although a larger MMN was found for tone than intonation condition. Source localization of the MMNs for all of the conditions showed the right hemispheric dominance, regardless of their linguistic functions (tone vs. intonation) or speech context (speech vs. nonspeech). Interestingly, the MMN generator for normal tone and hummed tone originated from the same cortical area (right parietal lobe, BA 19). These findings suggest that the pre-attentive cortical processing can be modulated not only by speech stimuli, but also by their nonspeech hums. Our data are compatible with the acoustic hypothesis of speech processing. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

We examine how well native speakers are able to distinguish ATR contrasts as well as the effects of harmony and disharmony on perception, thereby testing hypotheses that have been made in the literature about the perceptual motivations of harmony systems. We find that, as expected, ATR mid vowels and Retracted Tongue Root (RTR) high vowels are the hardest to distinguish in Dagaare, but contrary to expectations, harmony does not improve accuracy in discriminating ATR contrasts. Nonetheless, we find the accuracy on disharmonic disyllabic forms is significantly worse than the accuracy in monosyllabic forms, which may indicate that disharmony hurts perception. We examine the implications for our understanding of the motivations of harmony systems and discuss how this paper contributes to the very minimal existing literature on perception in African languages.												0	0											NOV 29	2023	14	1							8919	10.16995/labphon.8919	http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/labphon.8919												2026-01-16	WOS:001113068900001

In each of four experiments, listeners were presented with a target word embedded in a semantically neutral sentential context. The target word was produced with a mid level tone and it was never modified throughout the study, but on any given trial the fundamental frequency of part or all of the context sentence was raised or lowered to varying degrees. The effect of perceptual normalization of tone was quantified as the proportion of non-mid level responses given in F0-shifted contexts. Results showed that listeners' tonal judgments (i) were proportional to the degree of frequency shift, (ii) were not affected by non-pitch-related differences in talker, (iii) and were affected by the frequency of both the preceding and following context, although (iv) following context affected tonal decisions more strongly than did preceding context. These findings suggest that perceptual normalization of lexical tone may involve a "moving window" or "running average" type of mechanism, that selectively weights more recent pitch information over older information, but does not depend on the perception of a single voice.

J	Wiener, S; Lee, CY; Tao, L				Wiener, Seth; Lee, Chao-Yang; Tao, Liang			Statistical Regularities Affect the Perception of Second Language Speech: Evidence From Adult Classroom Learners of Mandarin Chinese	LANGUAGE LEARNING				Article								This study investigated how adult second language (L2) learners of Mandarin Chinese use knowledge of phonological and lexical statistical regularities when acoustic information is insufficient for word recognition. A gating task was used to test intermediate L2 learners at two time points across a semester of classroom learning. Native Mandarin speakers (tested once) served as a control group. Mixed-effects modeling revealed that upon hearing truncated speech, L2 learners, like native speakers, identified high token frequency syllable-tone combinations more accurately than low token frequency syllable-tone combinations. Error analysis of correct syllable/incorrect tone responses revealed that native speakers made specific probability-based errors. L2 learners primarily demonstrated more acoustic-based errors but exhibited a trend toward greater probability-based errors during the second test. These findings are interpreted in light of L2 speech learning models that emphasize a statistical learning mechanism. Open Practices This article has been awarded an Open Materials badge.

PROCESSING CANTONESE LEXICAL TONES: EVIDENCE FROM ODDBALL PARADIGMS	NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Two event-related potential (ERP) experiments were conducted to investigate whether Cantonese lexical tones are processed with general auditory perception mechanisms and/or a special speech module. Two tonal features (f0 direction and f0 height deviation) were manipulated to reflect acoustic processing, and the contrast between syllables and hums was used to reveal the involvement of a speech module. Experiment 1 adopted a passive oddball paradigm to study a relatively early stage of tonal processing. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and novelty P3 (P3a) were modulated by the interaction between tonal feature and stimulus type. Similar interactions were found for N2 and P3 in Experiment 2, where more in-depth tonal processing was examined with an active oddball paradigm. Moreover, detecting tonal deviants of syllables elicited N1 and P2 that were not found in hum detection. Together, these findings suggest that the processing of lexical tone relies on both acoustic and linguistic processes from the early stage. Another noteworthy finding is the absence of brain lateralization in both experiments, which challenges the use of a lateralization pattern as evidence for processing lexical tones through a special speech module.

However, it remains unknown whether tonal language speakers can also benefit from speech variability while learning second language (L2) lexical tones. Researchers also reported that the effectiveness of speech variability was only shown on learning new items. Considering that the first language (L1) and L2 probably share similar tonal categories, the present study hypothesizes that speech variability only promotes the tonal language speakers' acquisition of L2 tones that are different from the tones in their L1. To test this hypothesis, the present study trained native Mandarin (a tonal language) speakers to learn Cantonese tones with either high variability (HV) or low variability (LV) speech materials, and then compared their learning performance. The results partially supported this hypothesis: only Mandarin subjects' productions of Cantonese low level and mid level tones benefited from the speech variability. They probably relied on the mental representations in Li to learn the Cantonese tones that had similar Mandarin counterparts. This learning strategy limited the impact of speech variability. Furthermore, the results also revealed a discrepancy between L2 perception and production. The perception improvement may not necessarily lead to an improvement in production.												13	15											OCT 23	2018	9								1982	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01982	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01982												2026-01-16	WOS:000448025600001

An auditory verbal recognition paradigm was used in which native speakers of Mandarin Chinese were required to match a phonological unit that occurs in a list of three syllables to the corresponding unit of a following probe. The results show that hemispheric asymmetries arise depending on the type of phonological unit. In direct contrasts between phonological units, tones, relative to consonants and rhymes, yield increased activation in frontoparietal areas of the right hemisphere. This finding indicates that the cortical circuitry subserving lexical tones differs from that of consonants or rhymes.

To distinguish encoding of immediate memory from rehearsal, participants were required to match tones from the first and last positions of a three-syllable list to their following probes in an immediate-recognition paradigm. The first position task included intervening distractors between the target and probe. Increased activations were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus, right lateral cerebellum, and medial frontal gyrus for the target tone in first position. This network mediates articulatory encoding in immediate-response, and articulatory rehearsal in delayed-response paradigms. These findings support a working memory model in which rehearsal is optional, while encoding is an obligatory component of the phonological loop.												9	11											NOV 15	2004	15	16					2459	2462		10.1097/00001756-200411150-00005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001756-200411150-00005												2026-01-16	WOS:000225699900005
J	Wong, PS				Wong, Puisan			Acoustic characteristics of three-year-olds' correct and incorrect monosyllabic Mandarin lexical tone productions	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study aimed to provide insights into children's development of lexical tone production by combining both perceptual and acoustic analyses. Duration and fundamental frequency analyses were performed on the monosyllabic Mandarin lexical tones produced by the 13 three-year-old children and four female adults reported in Wong, Schwartz, and Jenkins (2005). Seven acoustic parameters that strongly associated with the tonal judgments of 10 Mandarin-speaking judges were identified. Qualitative differences of the seven parameters in adult correct, child correct, and child incorrect tone productions were compared and interpreted with reference to the perception data.. The results confirmed that three-year-old children do not produce adult-like tones in isolated monosyllabic words. Even children's tones that are correctly categorized by adult listeners are phonetically different than adults' tones. The four tones from the most to the least adult-like are Tone 4 (Falling), Tone 1 (High Level), Tone 2 (Rising), and Tone 3 (Falling-Rising), perhaps corresponding to the complexity of speech motor control for producing these tones. Children demonstrate more difficulties producing low fundamental frequencies than high fundamental frequencies. The findings support the position that tone acquisition is a protracted process, which may be affected by production complexities. (C) 2011 Elsevier' Ltd.

By simultaneously measuring first language (L1) Chinese and second language (L2) English prosodic sensitivity and reading comprehension, this study examined the mediating role of syntactic awareness on prosody-reading comprehension among Hong Kong Chinese-English bilingual children. Method: A group of 227 Hong Kong Chinese-English bilingual fourth graders completed L1 and L2 prosodic sensitivity (Cantonese lexical tone awareness and English prosodic sensitivity), syntactic awareness, and reading comprehension and control measures of cognitive (nonverbal IQ, short-term memory, and working memory), metalinguistic (phonological awareness and morphological awareness), linguistic (vocabulary knowledge), and word reading skills. Results: The within-language analyses showed a partial mediation effect of Chinese syntactic awareness on the relation between Cantonese lexical tone awareness and Chinese reading comprehension, but a full mediation effect of English syntactic awareness on the relation between English prosodic sensitivity and English reading comprehension. The cross-language analyses revealed a significant direct effect of Cantonese lexical tone awareness on English reading comprehension and a significant indirect effect of English prosodic sensitivity on Chinese reading comprehension via Chinese syntactic awareness. Conclusion: These findings suggest that, despite the language-independent mediating role of syntactic awareness in bridging prosody and reading comprehension, the degree of this mediation is shaped by language-specific prosody and its relations with other linguistic structures, including semantics.												4	5											JUL	2023	66	7					2362	2375		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00026												2026-01-16	WOS:001041295400011

Interlingual two-to-one mapping of tonal categories	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION				Article								Both Standard Chinese (SC) high- and low-rising tones sound like the rising tone in Jinan Mandarin (JM) Chinese. Acoustically (Experiment 1), the JM rising tone overlaps with both SC rising tones, but more with the high-rising tone than with the low-rising tone. Perceptually (Experiment 2), the JM rising tone was more likely identified as the SC high-rising tone by SC monolinguals. Experiment 3 examined the role of this two-to-one interlingual tonal mapping in bilingual lexical access. Final high-rising SC pseudo-words were more frequently and more quickly accepted as JM real words than final low-rising SC pseudo-words were. However, both high- and low-rising SC pseudo-words triggered equivalent facilitatory semantic priming on JM real-word targets. The results suggest that different tones are represented in the bilinguals' mental lexicon in terms of fine-grained and sometimes overlapping acoustic specifications.

Applying Rasch model analysis in the development of the cantonese tone identification test (CANTIT)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY				Article								Objective: Applying Rasch analysis to evaluate the internal structure of a lexical tone perception test known as the Cantonese Tone Identification Test (CANTIT). Design: A 75-item pool (CANTIT-75) with pictures and sound tracks was developed. Respondents were required to make a four-alternative forced choice on each item. A short version of 30 items (CANTIT-30) was developed based on fit statistics, difficulty estimates, and content evaluation. Internal structure was evaluated by fit statistics and Rasch Factor Analysis (RFA). Study Sample: 200 children with normal hearing and 141 children with hearing impairment were recruited. Results: For CANTIT-75, all infit and 97% of outfit values were <2.0. RFA revealed 40.1% of total variance was explained by the Rasch measure. The first residual component explained 2.5% of total variance in an eigenvalue of 3.1. For CANTIT-30, all infit and outfit values were <2.0. The Rasch measure explained 38.8% of total variance, the first residual component explained 3.9% of total variance in an eigenvalue of 1.9. Conclusions: The Rasch model provides excellent guidance for the development of short forms. Both CANTIT-75 and CANTIT-30 possess satisfactory internal structure as a construct validity evidence in measuring the lexical tone identification ability of the Cantonese speakers.												2	2												2017	56			2			S60	S73		10.1080/14992027.2017.1294766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2017.1294766												2026-01-16	WOS:000416647000008
J	Yu, LD; Zhang, Y				Yu, Luodi; Zhang, Yang			Testing native language neural commitment at the brainstem level: A cross-linguistic investigation of the association between frequency-following response and speech perception	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								A current topic in auditory neurophysiology is how brainstem sensory coding contributes to higher-level perceptual, linguistic and cognitive skills. This cross-language study was designed to compare frequency following responses (FFRs) for lexical tones in tonal (Mandarin Chinese) and non-tonal (English) language users and test the correlational strength between FFRs and behavior as a function of language experience. The behavioral measures were obtained in the Garner paradigm to assess how lexical tones might interfere with vowel category and duration judgement. The FFR results replicated previous findings about between-group differences, showing enhanced pitch tracking responses in the Chinese subjects. The behavioral data from the two subject groups showed that lexical tone variation in the vowel stimuli significantly interfered with vowel identification with a greater effect in the Chinese group. Moreover, the FFRs for lexical tone contours were significantly correlated with the behavioral interference only in the Chinese group. This pattern of language-specific association between speech perception and brainstem-level neural phase-locking of linguistic pitch information provides evidence for a possible native language neural commitment at the subcortical level, highlighting the role of experience dependent brainstem tuning in influencing subsequent linguistic processing in the adult brain.												13	16											JAN 31	2018	109						140	148		10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.12.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.12.022												2026-01-16	WOS:000425202400015

Because phonologies vary from language to language, acquiring the phonology of a language demands learning to attribute phonetic variation appropriately. Here, we studied the case of pitch-contour variation. In English, pitch contour does not differentiate words, but serves other functions, like marking yes/no questions and conveying emotions. We show that, in accordance with their phonology, English-speaking adults and 2-year-olds do not interpret salient pitch contours as inherent to novel words. We taught participants a new word with consistent segmental and pitch characteristics, and then tested word recognition for trained and deviant pronunciations using an eyegaze-based procedure. Vowel-quality mispronunciations impaired recognition, but large changes in pitch contour did not. By age 2, children already apply their knowledge of English phonology to interpret phonetic consistencies in their experience with words. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

How Tone, Intonation and Emotion Shape the Development of Infants' Fundamental Frequency Perception	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Review								Fundamental frequency (integral(0)), perceived as pitch, is the first and arguably most salient auditory component humans are exposed to since the beginning of life. It carries multiple linguistic (e.g., word meaning) and paralinguistic (e.g., speakers' emotion) functions in speech and communication. The mappings between these functions and integral(0) features vary within a language and differ cross-linguistically. For instance, a rising pitch can be perceived as a question in English but a lexical tone in Mandarin. Such variations mean that infants must learn the specific mappings based on their respective linguistic and social environments. To date, canonical theoretical frameworks and most empirical studies do not view or consider the multi-functionality of integral(0), but typically focus on individual functions. More importantly, despite the eventual mastery of integral(0) in communication, it is unclear how infants learn to decompose and recognize these overlapping functions carried by integral(0). In this paper, we review the symbioses and synergies of the lexical, intonational, and emotional functions that can be carried by integral(0) and are being acquired throughout infancy. On the basis of our review, we put forward the Learnability Hypothesis that infants decompose and acquire multiple integral(0) functions through native/environmental experiences. Under this hypothesis, we propose representative cases such as the synergy scenario, where infants use visual cues to disambiguate and decompose the different integral(0) functions. Further, viable ways to test the scenarios derived from this hypothesis are suggested across auditory and visual modalities. Discovering how infants learn to master the diverse functions carried by integral(0) can increase our understanding of linguistic systems, auditory processing and communication functions.												9	11											JUN 3	2022	13								906848	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906848	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906848												2026-01-16	WOS:000812838400001

Tone Attrition in Mandarin Speakers of Varying English Proficiency	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the degree of dominance of Mandarin-English bilinguals' languages affects phonetic processing of tone content in their native language, Mandarin. Method: We tested 72 Mandarin-English bilingual college students with a range of language-dominance profiles in the 2 languages and ages of acquisition of English. Participants viewed 2 photographs at a time while hearing a familiar Mandarin word referring to 1 photograph. The names of the 2 photographs diverged in tone, vowels, or both. Word recognition was evaluated using clicking accuracy, reaction times, and an online recognition measure (gaze) and was compared in the 3 conditions. Results: Relative proficiency in English was correlated with reduced word recognition success in tone-disambiguated trials, but not in vowel-disambiguated trials, across all 3 dependent measures. This selective attrition for tone content emerged even though all bilinguals had learned Mandarin from birth. Lengthy experience with English thus weakened tone use. Conclusions: This finding has implications for the question of the extent to which bilinguals' 2 phonetic systems interact. It suggests that bilinguals may not process pitch information language-specifically and that processing strategies from the dominant language may affect phonetic processing in the nondominant language-even when the latter was learned natively.												2	5											FEB	2017	60	2					293	305		10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-15-0248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-15-0248												2026-01-16	WOS:000394570200001
J	Tong, XL; Choi, W; Man, YY				Tong, Xiuli; Choi, William; Man, Yuen Ying			Tone language experience modulates the effect of long-term musical training on musical pitch perception	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Long-term musical training is widely reported to enhance music pitch perception. However, it remains unclear whether tone language experience influences the effect of long-term musical training on musical pitch perception. The present study addressed this question by testing 30 Cantonese and 30 non-tonal language speakers, each divided equally into musician and non-musician groups, on pitch height and pitch interval discrimination. Musicians outperformed non-musicians among non-tonal language speakers, but not among Cantonese speakers on the pitch height discrimination task. However, musicians outperformed non-musicians among Cantonese speakers, but not among non-tonal language speakers on the pitch interval discrimination task. These results suggest that the effect of long-term musical training on musical pitch perception is shaped by tone language experience and varies across different pitch perception tasks.

J	Wang, X; Jheng, JY; Mcmurray, B				Wang, Xin; Jheng, Jhe-Yu; Mcmurray, Bob			Tone superimposition technique in Speech Sciences: a tutorial	FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION				Article								In the literature, we encounter papers reporting manipulating pitch contours in speech tokens for a specific problem to be addressed in experiments (e.g., learning pitch patterns superimposed onto a pseudo-syllable), usually in the field of Speech Perception and Spoken Word Recognition. This type of research often tests listeners' perceptual and processing skills in tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin, Thai, etc.), and requires superimposing a pitch contour onto a spoken syllable. However, very few studies reported in detail how this critical manipulation was done to meet specific experimental needs. In addition, there was neither specific guideline or description of the techniques being used, nor how 'natural' these manipulated tokens sounded in a particular language upon speech synthesis. Because this technique is crucial in establishing the conclusions in various studies, here, we will demonstrate our method of establishing this technique of tone superimposition (i.e., lexical tones in Mandarin) onto English syllables. In line with the open science model, we will also show our stimuli and procedures via OSF for readers to evaluate the validity of this technique. Manipulating the pitch contour in a spoken syllable can be complicated and change the perception of the spoken syllable in a significant way. Thus, we will also show the important factors to be considered in this process for doing research in Speech Sciences.												0	0											DEC 4	2024	9								1439014	10.3389/feduc.2024.1439014	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1439014												2026-01-16	WOS:001380402100001

Three lexical tone continua were used: one ranging from low level to high level, one from high rising to high level, and one from low falling to high rising. Identification data showed steep slopes at category boundaries, suggesting that lexical tones are perceived categorically. In contrast, discrimination curves generally showed much weaker evidence for categorical perception. Subsequent investigation showed that the presence of a tonal context played a strong role in the identification of target tones and less of a role in discrimination. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that tonal category boundaries are determined by a combination of regions of natural auditory sensitivity and the influence of linguistic experience.												106	139											OCT	2003	65	7					1029	1044		10.3758/BF03194832	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03194832												2026-01-16	WOS:000186813600004
J	Tong, XL; He, XJ; Deacon, SH				Tong, Xiuli; He, Xinjie; Deacon, S. Helene			Tone matters for Cantonese-English bilingual children's English word reading development: A unified model of phonological transfer	MEMORY & COGNITION				Article								Languages differ considerably in how they use prosodic features, or variations in pitch, duration, and intensity, to distinguish one word from another. Prosodic features include lexical tone in Chinese and lexical stress in English. Recent cross-sectional studies show a surprising result that Mandarin Chinese tone sensitivity is related to Mandarin-English bilingual children's English word reading. This study explores the mechanism underlying this relation by testing two explanations of these effects: the prosodic hypothesis and segmental phonological awareness transfer. We administered multiple measures of Cantonese tone sensitivity, English stress sensitivity, segmental phonological awareness in Cantonese and English, nonverbal ability, and English word reading to 123 Cantonese-English bilingual children ages 7 and 8 years. Structural equation modeling revealed a longitudinal prediction of Cantonese tone sensitivity to English word reading between 8 and 9 years of age. This relation was realized through two parallel routes. In one, Cantonese tone sensitivity predicted English stress sensitivity, and English stress sensitivity, in turn, significantly predicted English word reading, as postulated by the prosodic hypothesis. In the second, Cantonese tone sensitivity predicted English word reading through the transfer of segmental phonological awareness between Cantonese and English, as predicted by segmental phonological transfer. These results support a unified model of phonological transfer, emphasizing the role of tone in English word reading for Cantonese-English bilingual children.												20	26											FEB	2017	45	2					320	333		10.3758/s13421-016-0657-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13421-016-0657-0												2026-01-16	WOS:000396911900012
J	Gao, YA; Toscano, JC; Shih, C; Tanner, D				Gao, Yang Agnes; Toscano, Joseph C.; Shih, Chilin; Tanner, Darren			Reassessing the electrophysiological evidence for categorical perception of Mandarin lexical tone: ERP evidence from native and naive non-native Mandarin listeners	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								Some studies have argued that native speakers of tonal languages have been shown to perceive lexical tone continua in a more categorical manner than speakers of non-tonal languages. Among these, Zhang and colleagues (NeuroReport 23 (1): 35-9) conducted an event-related potential (ERP) study using an oddball paradigm showing that native Mandarin speakers exhibit different sensitivity to deviant tones that cross category boundaries compared to deviants that belong to the same category as the standard. Other recent ERP findings examining consonant voicing categories question whether perception is truly categorical. The current study investigated these discrepant findings by replicating and extending the Zhang et al. study. Native Mandarin speakers and naive English speakers performed an auditory oddball detection test while ERPs were recorded. Naive English speakers were included to test for language experience effects. We found that Mandarin speakers and English speakers demonstrated qualitatively similar responses, in that both groups showed a larger N2 to the across-category deviant and a larger P3 to the within-category deviant. The N2/P3 pattern also did not differ in scalp topography for the within- versus across-category deviants, as was reported by Zhang et al. Cross-language differences surfaced in behavioral results, where Mandarin speakers showed better discrimination for the across-category deviant, but English speakers showed better discrimination for within-category deviants, though all results were near-ceiling. Our results therefore support models suggesting that listeners remain sensitive to gradient acoustic differences in speech even when they have learned phonological categories along an acoustic dimension.												6	6											FEB	2019	81	2					543	557		10.3758/s13414-018-1614-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-018-1614-8												2026-01-16	WOS:000455573300013
J	Chen, Y; Wang, T; Ding, HW				Chen, Yu; Wang, Ting; Ding, Hongwei			Effect of Age and Gender on Categorical Perception of Vocal Emotion Under Tonal Language Background	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Categorical perception (CP) manifests in various aspects of human cognition. While there is mounting evidence for CP in facial emotions, CP in vocal emotions remains understudied. The current study attempted to test whether individuals with a tonal language background perceive vocal emotions categorically and to examine how factors such as gender and age influence the plasticity of these perceptual categories. Method: This study examined the identification and discrimination performance of 24 Mandarin-speaking children (14 boys and 10 girls) and 32 adults (16 males and 16 females) when they were presented with three vocal emotion continua. Speech stimuli in each continuum consisted of 11 resynthesized Mandarin disyllabic words. Results: CP phenomena were detected when Mandarin participants perceived vocal emotions. We further found the modulating effect of age and gender in vocal emotion categorization. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate for the first time that a categorical strategy is used by Mandarin speakers when perceiving vocal emotions. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the categorization ability of vocal emotions follows a prolonged course of development and the maturation patterns differ across genders. This study opens a promising line of research for investigating how sensory features are mapped to higher order perception and provides implications for our understanding of clinical populations characterized by altered emotional processing.												0	1											NOV	2024	67	11					4567	4583		10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00716												2026-01-16	WOS:001356720600013

This study demonstrated that the artificial neural network can successfully classify Mandarin Chinese tone patterns produced by multiple children. The neural network can be used as an objective way of evaluating tone production of children. Objectives. Traditionally, tone production is evaluated subjectively using human listeners. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of using an artificial neural network in evaluating tone production of Mandarin-speaking children. Subjects and methods. Speech materials were recorded from 61 normal-hearing children. The fundamental frequency (F0) of each monosyllabic word was extracted and then used as inputs to a feed-forward backpropagation artificial neural network. The number of inputs was set at 12, whereas the number of hidden neurons was set at 16 in the neural network. The output layer consisted of four neurons representing the four Mandarin tone patterns. The tone recognition performance of the neural network was further compared with that of native Mandarin-speaking adult listeners. Results. The neural network successfully classified the tone patterns of the 61 child speakers with an accuracy of about 85% correct. This high accuracy exceeded the tone recognition performance by the adult listeners. Individual child speakers showed varied tone production accuracy as recognized by the adult listeners or by the neural network.												9	12												2007	127	4					365	369		10.1080/00016480601011477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016480601011477												2026-01-16	WOS:000246298700005

Language-related areas including Broca's area, Wernicke's area, auditory cortex, and supplementary motor regions were active in all subjects before and after training and did not vary in average location. Across all subjects, improvements in performance were associated with an increase in the spatial extent of activation in left superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann's area 22, putative Wernicke's area), the emergence of activity in adjacent Brodmann's area 42, and the emergence of activity in right inferior frontal gyrus ( Brodmann's area 44), a homologue of putative Broca's area. These findings demonstrate a form of enrichment plasticity in which the early cortical effects of learning a tone-based second language involve both expansion of preexisting language-related areas and recruitment of additional cortical regions specialized for functions similar to the new language functions.												137	179											OCT	2003	15	7					1019	1027		10.1162/089892903770007407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089892903770007407												2026-01-16	WOS:000186004600011

Cross-linguistic contributions of acoustic cues and prosodic awareness to first and second language vocabulary knowledge	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN READING				Article								Background Several studies have revealed that prosody contributes to reading acquisition. However, the relation between awareness of prosodic patterns and different facets of language ability (e.g., vocabulary knowledge) in school-age children remains unclear. This study measured awareness of prosodic patterns using non-speech and speech stimuli. Methods Hierarchical regression equations were computed to examine links among auditory cues (e.g., amplitude rise time, pitch contour and interval), language-specific prosodic awareness and children's vocabulary knowledge in Mandarin as a first language (L1) and English as a second language (L2) after controlling for age and nonverbal IQ. Results Results revealed that (1) amplitude envelope rise time discrimination predicted Mandarin L1 and English L2 vocabulary knowledge, (2) Mandarin tone perception and rhyme awareness did not predict Mandarin L1 vocabulary and (3) English rhyme awareness better predicted English L2 vocabulary than did stress production. Conclusion Our findings suggest that (1) amplitude rise time, which signals syllable boundaries, is a cross-linguistic predictor of vocabulary knowledge and (2) the development of English L2 vocabulary may depend on phonological more than prosodic awareness.												5	5											MAY	2021	44	2					434	452		10.1111/1467-9817.12349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9817.12349		JAN 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000604612100001

It remains unclear, however, how they handle the extensive variability inherent to speech, and how they process multiple linguistic functions that share the same acoustic parameters. Across four neural network simulations of lexical tone acquisition, self-organizing maps were trained with continuous speech input of increasing variability. Robust tonal categorization was achieved by tracking the velocity profiles of fundamental frequency contours. This result suggests that continuous speech signal carries sufficient categorical information that can be directly processed, and that dynamic acoustic information can be used for resolving the variability problem.

J	Cai, T; McPherson, B; Li, CW; Yang, F				Cai, Ting; McPherson, Bradley; Li, Caiwei; Yang, Feng			Tone perception in Mandarin-speaking school age children with otitis media with effusion	PLOS ONE				Article								Objectives The present study explored tone perception ability in school age Mandarin-speaking children with otitis media with effusion (OME) in noisy listening environments. The study investigated the interaction effects of noise, tone type, age, and hearing status on monaural tone perception, and assessed the application of a hierarchical clustering algorithm for profiling hearing impairment in children with OME. Methods Forty-one children with normal hearing and normal middle ear status and 84 children with OME with or without hearing loss participated in this study. The children with OME were further divided into two subgroups based on their severity and pattern of hearing loss using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Monaural tone recognition was measured using a picture-identification test format incorporating six sets of monosyllabic words conveying four lexical tones under speech spectrum noise, with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from -9 to -21 dB. Results Linear correlation indicated tone recognition thresholds of children with OME were significantly correlated with age and pure tone hearing thresholds at every frequency tested. Children with hearing thresholds less affected by OME performed similarly to their peers with normal hearing. Tone recognition thresholds of children with auditory status more affected by OME were significantly inferior to those of children with normal hearing or with minor hearing loss. Younger children demonstrated poorer tone recognition performance than older children with OME. A mixed design repeated-measure ANCOVA showed significant main effects of listening condition, hearing status, and tone type on tone recognition. Contrast comparisons revealed that tone recognition scores were significantly better under -12 dB SNR than under -15 dB SNR conditions and tone recognition scores were significantly worse under -18 dB SNR than those obtained under -15 dB SNR conditions. Tone 1 was the easiest tone to identify and Tone 3 was the most difficult tone to identify for all participants, when considering -12, -15, and -18 dB SNR as within-subject variables. The interaction effect between hearing status and tone type indicated that children with greater levels of OME-related hearing loss had more impaired tone perception of Tone 1 and Tone 2 compared to their peers with lesser levels of OME-related hearing loss. However, tone perception of Tone 3 and Tone 4 remained similar among all three groups. Tone 2 and Tone 3 were the most perceptually difficult tones for children with or without OME-related hearing loss in all listening conditions. Conclusions The hierarchical clustering algorithm demonstrated usefulness in risk stratification for tone perception deficiency in children with OME- related hearing loss. There was marked impairment in tone perception in noise for children with greater levels of OME- related hearing loss. Monaural lexical tone perception in younger children was more vulnerable to noise and OME- related hearing loss than that in older children.												2	2											AUG 22	2017	12	8							e0183394	10.1371/journal.pone.0183394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183394												2026-01-16	WOS:000408085100043

Enhancing lexical tone learning for second language speakers: effects of acoustic properties in Mandarin tone perception	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Understanding the challenges faced by second language (L2) learners in lexical tone perception is crucial for effective language acquisition. This study investigates the impact of exaggerated acoustic properties on facilitating Mandarin tone learning for English speakers. Using synthesized tone stimuli, we systematically manipulated pitch contours through three key modifications: expanding the fundamental frequency (F0), increasing F0 (female voice), and extending the overall duration. Our objectives were to assess the influence of F0 expansion, higher F0, longer duration, and varied syllables on Mandarin tone learning and generalization. Participants engaged in a non-adaptive trial-by-trial tone identification task. Mixed-effects logistic regression modeling was used to analyze accuracy across learning phases, acoustic factors, and tones. Findings reveal improvements in accuracy from training to testing and generalization phases, indicating the effectiveness of perceptual training to tone perception for adult English speakers. Tone 1 emerged as the easiest to perceive, while Tone 3 posed the most challenge, consistent with established hierarchies of tonal acquisition difficulty. Analysis of acoustic factors highlighted tone-specific effects. Expanded F0 was beneficial for the identification of Tone 2 and Tone 3 but posed challenges for Tone 1 and Tone 4. Additionally, longer durations also exhibited varied effects across tones, aiding in the identification of Tone 3 and Tone 4 but hindering Tone 1 identification. The higher F0 was advantageous for Tone 2 but disadvantageous for Tone 3. Furthermore, the syllable ma facilitated the identification of Tone 1 and Tone 2 but not for Tone 3 and Tone 4.

Still, information is lacking about the contribution of basic auditory mechanisms to this process. This study aimed to evaluate when native language experience starts to noticeably affect the perceptual processing of basic acoustic cues [i.e., frequency-modulation (FM) and amplitude-modulation information] known to be crucial for speech perception in adults. The discrimination of a lexical-tone contrast (rising versus low) was assessed in 6- and 10-month-old infants learning either French or Mandarin using a visual habituation paradigm. The lexical tones were presented in two conditions designed to either keep intact or to severely degrade the FM and fine spectral cues needed to accurately perceive voice-pitch trajectory. A third condition was designed to assess the discrimination of the same voice-pitch trajectories using click trains containing only the FM cues related to the fundamental-frequency (FO) in French- and Mandarin-learning 10-month-old infants. Results showed that the younger infants of both language groups and the Mandarin-learning 10-month-olds discriminated the intact lexical-tone contrast while French-learning 10-month-olds failed. However, only the French 10-month-olds discriminated degraded lexical tones when FM, and thus voice-pitch cues were reduced. Moreover, Mandarin-learning 10-month-olds were found to discriminate the pitch trajectories as presented in click trains better than French infants. Altogether, these results reveal that the perceptual reorganization occurring during the first year of life for lexical tones is coupled with changes in the auditory ability to use speech modulation cues.												17	17											AUG 28	2015	6								1290	10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01290	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01290												2026-01-16	WOS:000360403800001

In total, 28 participants with SHF-SNHL were assigned to 3 groups according to the cut-off frequency (1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively) of their pure-tone absolute thresholds. Fourteen age-matched normal-hearing (NH) individuals were enrolled as controls. For each Mandarin sentence, the acoustic TFS in 10 frequency bands (each 3-ERB wide) was extracted using the Hilbert transform and was further lowpass filtered at 1, 2, and 4 kHz. Speech recognition scores were compared among the NH and 1-, 2-, and 4-kHz SHF-SNHL groups using stimuli with varying bandwidths. Results showed that speech recognition with the same TFS-speech stimulus bandwidth differed significantly in groups and filtering conditions. Sentence recognition in quiet conditions was better than that in noise. Compared with the NH participants, nearly all the SHF-SNHL participants showed significantly poorer sentence recognition within their frequency regions with "normal hearing" (defined clinically by normal absolute thresholds) in both quiet and noisy conditions. These may result from disrupted auditory nerve function in the "normal hearing" low-frequency regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, Y; Zhao, XX; Yang, XH				Li, Yang; Zhao, Xinxian; Yang, Xiaohu			Amateur Choir Experience Modulates the Perception of Mandarin Sounds in Older Adults	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Existing literature suggests that musical experience can enhance the auditory perception of acoustic features. However, it remains unclear whether such improvements in acoustic processing affect speech perception in older adults. The present study aimed to explore whether older adults with amateur choir experience can exhibit finer processing of acoustic features in perceiving Mandarin sounds than those without such experience, as indicated by hemispheric lateralization patterns in processing acoustic attributes of Mandarin sounds and the performance in lexical tone identification based on different acoustic cues. Method: Two experiments were conducted in this study. Experiment 1 compared the performance of older adults with and without amateur choir experience in dichotic listening tasks based on consonant-vowel (CV) syllables varying in consonants, vowels, and lexical tones. Experiment 2 examined the performance of two groups of older adults in identifying Mandarin tones under the fundamental frequency (F0)-only (with equal durations) and F0 + duration (with natural durations) conditions. Results: Experiment 1 revealed that older adults with amateur choir experience demonstrated an analytical processing mode for time and frequency features of speech sounds, as evidenced by more pronounced left-hemispheric lateralization in dichotic listening tasks based on CV syllables varying in consonants and in lexical tones. Furthermore, Experiment 2 showed that older adults with choir experience exhibited better performance than those without such experience in lexical tone identification under both the F0-only and F0 + duration conditions. Conclusions: The amateur choir experience may lead to an analytical processing mode of time and frequency features and boost the identification accuracy of Mandarin sounds based on these cues in the aging population. These findings substantiate the overlap, precision, emotion, repetition, and attention hypothesis and highlight the beneficial impact of amateur choir experience on speech perception.												0	0											OCT	2025	68	10					4978	4995		10.1044/2025_JSLHR-24-00724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2025_JSLHR-24-00724												2026-01-16	WOS:001613747600025
J	Tao, L				Tao, Liang			SYNTACTIC TONE AND DISCOURSE PROCESSING IN BEIJING MANDARIN: A CASE STUDY	JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS				Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Spoken Word Access and Processes	2000	Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, NETHERLANDS		Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist			Three experiments tested the role of an emerging syntactic tone in spoken word recognition of Beijing Mandarin Chinese. The study examined the role of the new syntactic tone in lexical access and how synchronic change is perceived in the task of word recognition. Experiment 1 used an information-deprived condition where information for the standard interpretation of the word was provided prior to the crucial tone, but the syntactic tone based interpretation was not provided. Experiment 2 used a prosody-reduced condition where the prosodic cues were unclear while information for both standard and syntactic tone based interpretation was provided. Experiment 3 involved a story retell task to further assess tone comprehension. The results show that the emerging syntactic tone had an impact on participant's lexical interpretations, although the impact was more obvious when prosody information was clearly provided. The results also confirmed participants' tone comprehension through story retells. The results support the hypotheses that a) there is a new syntactic tone in spoken Beijing Mandarin whose function goes beyond lexical tone, which has become a precursor for word recognition in discourse processing; and, b) language processing reflects asymmetry in that speakers prefer the traditional grammatical interpretation more than the interpretation derived from the newly developed syntactic tone when prosodic information is unclear. The study demonstrates how usage-based grammatical changes affect speaker's mental model of lexical access.												2	2											JUN	2009	37	2					257	296															2026-01-16	WOS:000268967500004
J	Tsao, FM				Tsao, Feng-Ming			Perceptual Improvement of Lexical Tones in Infants: Effects of Tone Language Experience	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								To learn words in a tonal language, tone-language learners should not only develop better abilities for perceiving consonants and vowels, but also for lexical tones. The divergent trend of enhancing sensitivity to native phonetic contrasts and reduced sensitivity to non-native phonetic contrast is theoretically essential to evaluate effects of listening to an ambient language on speech perception development. The loss of sensitivity in discriminating lexical tones among non-tonal language-learning infants was apparent between 6 and 12 months of age, but only few studies examined trends of differentiating native lexical tones in infancy. The sensitivity in discriminating lexical tones among 6-8 and 10-12 month-old Mandarin-learning infants (n = 120) was tested in Experiment 1 using three lexical tone contrasts of Mandarin. Facilitation of linguistic experience was shown in the tonal contrast (Tone 1 vs. 3), but both age groups performed similar in the other two tonal contrasts (Tone 2 vs. 4; Tone 2 vs. 3). In Experiment 2, 6-8 and 10-12 month-old Mandarin-learning infants (n = 90) were tested with tonal contrasts that have pitch contours either similar to or inverse from lexical tones in Mandarin, and perceptual improvement was shown only in a tonal contrast with familiar pitch contours (i.e., Tone 1 vs. 3). In Experiment 3, 6-8 and 10-12 month-old English-learning infants (n = 40) were tested with Tone 1 vs. 3 contrast of Mandarin and showed an improvement in the perception of non-native lexical tones. This study reveals that tone-language learning infants develop more accurate representations of lexical tones around their first birthday, and the results of both tone and non-tone language-learning infants imply that the rate of development depends on listening experience and the acoustical salience of specific tone contrasts.												38	42											APR 11	2017	8								558	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00558	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00558												2026-01-16	WOS:000399316600001

However, recent studies have also demonstrated that language experience and auditory training enhance the temporal dynamics of sound encoding in the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The purpose of this study was to explore the pitch processing ability at the brainstem level in an aging population that has a tonal language background. Method: Mandarin speaking younger (n = 12) and older (n = 12) adults were recruited for this study. All participants had normal audiometric test results and normal suprathreshold click-evoked ABR. To record frequency following responses (FFRs) elicited by Mandarin lexical tones, two Mandarin Chinese syllables with different fundamental frequency pitch contours (Flat Tone and Falling Tone) were presented at 70 dB SPL. Fundamental frequencies (f0) of both the stimulus and the responses were extracted and compared to individual brainstem responses. Two indices were used to examine different aspects of pitch processing ability at the brainstem level: Pitch Strength and Pitch Correlation. Results: Lexical tone elicited FFR were overall weaker in the older adult group compared to their younger adult counterpart. Measured by Pitch Strength and Pitch Correlation, statistically significant group differences were only found when the tone with a falling f0 (Falling Tone) were used as the stimulus. Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrated that in a tonal language speaking population, pitch processing ability at the brainstem level of older adults are not as strong and robust as their younger counterparts. Findings of this study are consistent with previous reports on brainstem responses of older adults whose native language is English. On the other hand, lexical tone elicited FFRs have been shown to correlate with the length of language exposure. Older adults' degraded responses in our study may also be due to that, the Mandarin speaking older adults' long term exposure somewhat counteracted the negative impact on aging and helped maintain, or at least reduced, the degradation rate in their temporal processing capacity at the brainstem level.												5	6											NOV 29	2016	8								286	10.3389/fnagi.2016.00286	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00286												2026-01-16	WOS:000388767600001
J	Lin, JX; Zhang, HM; Lin, XY				Lin, Jiexin; Zhang, Haomin; Lin, Xiaoyu			Prosodic Transfer in English Literacy Skills among Chinese Elementary-Age Students: Controlling for Non-Verbal Intelligence	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE				Article								Building upon the prosodic transfer hypothesis, the current study aims to examine the intermediary effect of English stress on the relation between Chinese lexical tone awareness and English word-level literacy (reading and spelling) as well as the moderating effect of English oral vocabulary proficiency on the cross-linguistic association. Grade 4 Chinese learners of English (N = 224) participated in this study and were assessed for their tone and stress sensitivity, English oral vocabulary, English word reading, and English word spelling. Mediated multivariate analyses with moderation were used to explore: (1) whether the influence of lexical tone perception on L2 word reading and spelling was mediated by English stress as posited in the prosodic transfer hypothesis; (2) whether the effects of tone on English word reading and spelling performance varied as a function of oral vocabulary levels. The findings revealed a direct positive relationship between Chinese tone and English word reading and spelling, and the relationship was mediated by English stress awareness. Furthermore, the direct pathway from tone to English word-level literacy skills were moderated by oral vocabulary and the relationship between tone and English word-level skills became stronger as oral vocabulary levels increased; however, such strength reached a plateau among children without adequate oral vocabulary skills. These findings suggest the necessity to incorporate word spelling as an outcome in the cross-suprasegmental phonological transfer models of early literacy development. Additionally, the current study endorses the complexity of cross-language prosodic transfer. It points to a precise threshold for sufficient L2 oral vocabulary skills to enable tone transfer in English word-level literacy attainment.												3	3											DEC	2022	10	4							114	10.3390/jintelligence10040114	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jintelligence10040114												2026-01-16	WOS:000902497400001
J	Li, XQ; Chen, YY				Li, Xiaoqing; Chen, Yiya			Representation and Processing of Lexical Tone and Tonal Variants: Evidence from the Mismatch Negativity	PLOS ONE				Article								Pronunciation variation is ubiquitous in the speech signal. Different models of lexical representation have been put forward to deal with speech variability, which differ in the level as well as the nature of mental representation. We present the first mismatch negativity (MMN) study investigating the effect of allophonic variation on the mental representation and neural processing of lexical tones. Native speakers of Standard Chinese (SC) participated in an oddball electroencephalography (EEG) experiment. All stimuli have the same segments (ma) but different lexical tones: level [T1], rising [T2], and dipping [T3]. In connected speech with a T3T3 sequence, the first T3 may undergo allophonic change and is produced with a rising pitch contour (T3V), similar to the lexical T2 pitch contour. Four oddball conditions were constructed (T1/T3, T3/T1, T2/T3, T3/T2; standard/deviant). All four conditions elicited MMN effects, with the T1-T3 pair eliciting comparable MMNs, but the T2-T3 pair asymmetrical MMN effects. There were significantly greater and earlier MMN effects in the T2/T3 condition than that in the reversed T3/T2 condition. Furthermore, the T3/T2 condition showed more rightward MMN effects than the T2/T3 condition and the T1-T3 pair. Such asymmetries suggest co-activation of long-term memory representations of both T3 and T3V when T3 serves as the standard. The acoustic similarity between the activated T3V (by the standard T3) and the incoming deviant stimulus T2 induces acoustic processing of the tonal contrast in the T3/T2 condition, similar to that of within-category lexical tone processing, which is in contrast to the processing of between-category lexical tones observed in the T2/T3, T1/T3, and T3/T1 conditions.												33	37											DEC 1	2015	10	12							e0143097	10.1371/journal.pone.0143097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143097												2026-01-16	WOS:000365891600014
J	Ou, SC; Guo, ZC				Ou, Shu-chen; Guo, Zhe-chen			The Language-specific Use of Fundamental Frequency Rise in Segmentation of an Artificial Language: Evidence from Listeners of Taiwanese Southern Min	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Experience with native-language prosody encourages language-specific strategies for speech segmentation. Conflicting findings from previous research suggest that these strategies may not be abstracted away from the acoustic manifestation of prosodic features in the native speech. Using the artificial language learning paradigm, the current study explores this possibility in connection with listeners of a lexical tone language called Taiwanese Southern Min (TSM). In TSM, the only rising lexical tone occurs almost only on the final syllable of the language's tone sandhi domain and is phonetically associated with final lengthening. Based on these observations, Experiment I examined what constituted a sufficient finality cue for use by TSM listeners to support segmentation: (a) final fundamental frequency (F0) rise only; or (b) final F0 rise conjoined with final lengthening. The results showed that segmentation was inhibited by the former cue but facilitated by the latter. Experiment II showed that the facilitation cannot be attributed entirely to final lengthening, as a null effect was found when final lengthening was the sole prosodic cue to segmentation. It is thus assumed that acoustic details as fine-grained as the lengthening of the rising tone are involved in the modulation of the segmentation strategy whereby TSM listeners perceive F0 rise as signaling finality. The inhibitory effect of final F0 rise alone found in Experiment I motivated Experiment III, which revealed that initial F0 rise in the absence of lengthening cues improved TSM listeners' segmentation. It is speculated that such use of initial F0 rise might reflect a cross-linguistic segmentation solution.												7	7											JUN	2021	64	2			SI		437	466	0023830919886604	10.1177/0023830919886604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830919886604		NOV 2019										2026-01-16	WOS:000497102900001

Thirteen 3-year-old, Mandarin-speaking children participated in the study. Tone perception was examined by a picture-pointing task, and tone production was investigated by picture naming. To compare children's productions with the adult forms, 4 mothers of the children were asked to say the same set of words to their children in a picture-reading activity. The children's and mothers' productions were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and 400 Hz, respectively, to eliminate segmental information. Ten Mandarin-speaking judges identified the productions of tones from the filtered speech. Adult productions were more accurately identified than productions of the children. The children perceived the level, rising, and falling tones with relatively high accuracy. The dipping tone posed the greatest difficulty for the children in both perception and production.												113	132											OCT	2005	48	5					1065	1079		10.1044/1092-4388(2005/074)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2005/074)												2026-01-16	WOS:000234963100008

Listeners in both groups showed more benefit from pitch information in read than in spontaneous speech. Mandarin listeners showed a greater benefit than Malay listeners from the inclusion of f0 information in a segmentally degraded signal, suggesting that experience with lexical tone may extend to increased attention and/or sensitivity to phrase-level pitch contours.

J	Zeng, YY; Fiorentino, R; Zhang, J				Zeng, Yuyu; Fiorentino, Robert; Zhang, Jie			Electrophysiological Signatures of Perceiving Alternated Tone in Mandarin Chinese: Mismatch Negativity to Underlying Tone Conflict	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Although phonological alternation is prevalent in languages, the process of perceiving phonologically alternated sounds is poorly understood, especially at the neurolinguistic level. We examined the process of perceiving Mandarin 3rd tone sandhi (T3 + T3 -> T2 + T3) with a mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment. Our design has two independent variables (whether the deviant undergoes tone sandhi; whether the standard and the deviant have matched underlying tone). These two independent variables modulated ERP responses in both the first and the second syllables. Notably, despite the apparent segmental conflict between the standard and the deviant in all conditions, MMN is only observed when neither the standard nor the deviant undergoes tone sandhi, suggesting that discovering the underlying representation of an alternated sound could interfere with the generation of MMN. A tentative model with three hypothesized underlying processing mechanisms is proposed to explain the observed latency and amplitude differences across conditions. The results are also discussed in light of the potential electrophysiological signatures involved in the process of perceiving alternated sounds.												2	2											SEP 27	2021	12								735593	10.3389/fpsyg.2021.735593	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.735593												2026-01-16	WOS:000705508600001

In Experiment 1, there was better auditory-only and auditory-visual discrimination by tone and pitch-accent language speakers than by nontone language speakers. Conversely and counterintuitively, there was better visual-only discrimination by nontone language speakers than tone and pitch-accent language speakers. Nevertheless, visual augmentation of auditory tone perception in noise was evident for all five language groups. In Experiment 2, involving discrimination in three fundamental frequency equivalent auditory contexts, tone and pitch-accent language participants showed equivalent discrimination for normal Thai speech, filtered speech, and violin sounds. In contrast, nontone language listeners had significantly better discrimination for violin sounds than filtered speech and in turn speech. Together the results show that tone perception is determined by both auditory and visual information, by acoustic and linguistic contexts, and by universal and experiential factors.												44	48											NOV	2015	36	6					1459	1491		10.1017/S0142716414000496	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0142716414000496												2026-01-16	WOS:000368233000007

Individual apt tude in Mandarin lexical tone perception predicts effectiveness of high-variability training	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Although the high-variability training method can enhance learning of non-native speech categories, this can depend on individuals' aptitude. The current study asked how general the effects of perceptual aptitude are by testing whether they occur with training materials spoken by native speakers and whether they depend on the nature of the to-be-learned material. Forty-five native Dutch listeners took part in a 5-day training procedure in which they identified bisyllabic Mandarin pseudowords (e.g., asa) pronounced with different lexical tone combinations. The training materials were presented to different groups of listeners at three levels of variability: low (many repetitions of a limited set of words recorded by a single speaker), medium (fewer repetitions of a more variable set of words recorded by three speakers), and high (similar to medium but with five speakers). Overall, variability did not influence learning performance, but this was due to an interaction with individuals' perceptual aptitude: increasing variability hindered improvements in performance for low-aptitude perceivers while it helped improvements in performance for high-aptitude perceivers. These results show that the previously observed interaction between individuals' aptitude and effects of degree of variability extends to natural tokens of Mandarin speech. This interaction was not found, however, in a closely matched study in which native Dutch listeners were trained on the Japanese geminate/singleton consonant contrast. This may indicate that the effectiveness of high-variability training depends not only on individuals' aptitude in speech perception but also on the nature of the categories being acquired.												54	60											NOV 25	2014	5								1318	10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01318	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01318												2026-01-16	WOS:000345528300002
J	Cabrera, L; Bijeljac-Babic, R; Bertoncini, J				Cabrera, Laurianne; Bijeljac-Babic, Ranka; Bertoncini, Josiane			The development of consonant and lexical-tone discrimination between 3 and 6 years: Effect of language exposure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUALISM				Article								Aims and objectives: The present study explored children's discrimination capacities for lexical tones and consonants between 3 and 6 years of age and the effect of native language on this ability. Recent studies in infants have shown a perceptual rebound for non-native listeners during the second year of life, but only for lexical tones. However, the later stages of development, and particularly when children start pre-school, are yet not clear. Design: Discrimination abilities of 134 children were measured in three age groups between 3 and 6 years using a behavioural task where children detected a change in lexical tones or consonants. Children were either French monolinguals, French bilinguals exposed to an Asian tone language or French bilinguals exposed to a second non-tone language at home. Data and analysis: Overall, results indicated that higher detection scores for consonants were observed from 4 to 5 years, while for lexical tones the highest scores were observed only at 5-6 years. Moreover, bilingual children exposed to an Asian tone language had higher scores for tones compared to monolingual French children. Interestingly, both bilingual groups, whether exposed to an Asian tone language or to a non-tone language, had better scores for tones than for French consonants, while monolinguals performed equally with both. Conclusions: Language exposure from an early age influences phonological development and bilingualism seems to enhance the perception of prosodic information. Originality: This study is the first to show a different developmental trajectory for consonant and lexical-tone discrimination between 3 and 6 years according to the native language.												2	2											DEC	2019	23	6					1249	1263		10.1177/1367006918781077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367006918781077												2026-01-16	WOS:000485296700002

Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.												0	0											JAN 1	2026	38	1					55	70		10.1162/JOCN.a.84	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/JOCN.a.84												2026-01-16	WOS:001641426400004
J	Chen, YC; Lin, WJ				Chen, Yuchun; Lin, Wen-Jing			Efficacy of an integrated intervention with vocabulary and phonetic training for Mandarin-speaking children with developmental language disorders	CHILD LANGUAGE TEACHING & THERAPY				Article								Background: Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) demonstrate deficits in vocabulary development and novel word learning processes, which have been proposed to stem from their speech perception deficits. Aims: This study had two aims. The first was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention incorporating a computer-based phonetic training programme with rich and explicit vocabulary instruction. The second aim was to investigate the adjuvant treatment effect of phonetic training on word learning performance. Methods and procedures: The experimental group comprised 34 children with DLD aged 5-7 years, and the control group comprised another 15 children with DLD. All participants in the experimental group attended 1-h direct vocabulary instruction classes weekly for 9 weeks. They were also asked to play computer-based phonetic training games individually at home or school. Pre-post differences between groups in word definition and speech perception tasks were examined. The relationship between the experimental group's vocabulary learning performance and scores on the phonetic training games was examined using correlation analysis. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed that children in the experimental group exhibited significantly greater pre-post gains in word definition task than did the control group. Children in the experimental group performed better in the lexical tone posttest No improvement in the speech discrimination tasks was detected in the control group. Finally, correlation analyses indicated a positive relationship between the total number of phonetic games played and the pre-post gain in the word definition production task. The children's response accuracy in the lexical tone discrimination games was significantly correlated with the performance of the posttest tone discrimination task and the pre-post gain in the word definition task. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that vocabulary intervention programmes incorporating speech perception training promote children's vocabulary and speech perception abilities. These findings can serve as evidence to support future school-based studies.												7	7											OCT	2022	38	3					288	302	02656590221101180	10.1177/02656590221101180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02656590221101180		MAY 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000798759000001
J	Kong, FH; Zhou, HL; Zheng, NH; Meng, QL				Kong, Fanhui; Zhou, Huali; Zheng, Nengheng; Meng, Qinglin			Sparse representation of speech using an atomic speech modela)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Speech perception has been extensively studied using degradation algorithms such as channel vocoding, mosaic speech, and pointillistic speech. Here, an "atomic speech model" is introduced to generate unique sparse time-frequency patterns. It processes speech signals using a bank of bandpass filters, undersamples the signals, and reproduces each sample using a Gaussian-enveloped tone (a Gabor atom). To examine atomic speech intelligibility, adaptive speech reception thresholds (SRTs) are measured as a function of atom rate in normal-hearing listeners, investigating the effects of spectral maxima, binaural integration, and single echo. Experiment 1 showed atomic speech with 4 spectral maxima out of 32 bands remained intelligible even at a low rate under 80 atoms per second. Experiment 2 showed that when atoms were nonoverlappingly assigned to both ears, the mean SRT increased (i.e., worsened) compared to the monaural condition, where all atoms were assigned to one ear. Individual data revealed that a few listeners could integrate information from both ears, performing comparably to the monaural condition. Experiment 3 indicated higher mean SRT with a 100 ms echo delay than that with shorter delays (e.g., 50, 25, and 0 ms). These findings demonstrate the utility of the atomic speech model for investigating speech perception and its underlying mechanisms.												0	0											MAR	2025	157	3					1899	1911		10.1121/10.0036144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0036144												2026-01-16	WOS:001447578100004
J	Shook, A; Marian, V				Shook, Anthony; Marian, Viorica			The influence of native-language tones on lexical access in the second language	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								When listening to speech in a second language, bilinguals' perception of acoustic-phonetic properties is often influenced by the features that are important in the native language of the bilingual. Furthermore, changes in the perception of segmental contrasts due to L1 experience can influence L2 lexical access during comprehension. The present study investigates whether the effect of L1 experience on L2 processing seen at the segmental level extends to suprasegmental processing. In an eye-tracking task, Mandarin-English bilinguals heard an auditorily presented English word and selected which of two visually presented Chinese characters represented the correct Mandarin translation. The pitch contour of the spoken word was manipulated to either match or mismatch the lexical tone of the Mandarin translation. Results revealed that bilinguals were significantly faster to correctly identify the target and made earlier eye movements to targets when the suprasegmental information of the word spoken in English matched that of its Mandarin translation. The findings provide compelling evidence for bilinguals' sensitivity to suprasegmental tone information, even when listening to a non-tonal language. These results have important implications for the effect of L1 experience on L2 lexical access and language interaction in bilinguals, and are consistent with a highly interactive account of language processing.

J	Wang, XC				Wang, Xinchun			Perception of Mandarin Tones: The Effect of L1 Background and Training	MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL				Article								This study investigates whether native Hmong speakers' first language (L1) lexical tone experience facilitates or interferes with their perception of Mandarin tones and whether training is effective for perceptual learning of second (L2) tones. In Experiment 1, 3 groups of beginning level learners of Mandarin with different L1 prosodic background (Hmong, Japanese, and English) took a perception test on Mandarin tones. Both the English and Japanese groups outperformed the Hmong group in perceptual accuracy of Mandarin tones. In Experiment 2, 18 learners with different L1 background received either perception training only or perception with production training on Mandarin tones for 6 hours within 34 weeks. Both training paradigms were effective for perceptual learning of Mandarin tone contrasts as the two training groups' perceptual accuracy improved significantly at posttest compared with a control group. Although Hmong speakers initially had more difficulties in perception of Mandarin tones than the other 2 groups, they are by no means disadvantaged by their L1 prosodic background as they gain L2 experience after intensive training.												41	63											SPR	2013	97	1					144	160		10.1111/j.1540-4781.2013.01386.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4781.2013.01386.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000315622700006

CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION OF LEXICAL TONES IN CHINESE REVEALED BY MISMATCH NEGATIVITY	NEUROSCIENCE				Article								The present study investigated the neurophysiological correlates of categorical perception of Chinese lexical tones in Mandarin Chinese. Relative to standard stimuli, both within- and across-category deviants elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) in bilateral frontal-central recording sites. The MMN elicited in the right sites was marginally larger than in the left sites, which reflects the role of the right hemisphere in acoustic processing. At the same time, relative to within-category deviants, the across-category deviants elicited larger MMN in the left recording sites, reflecting the long-term phonemic traces of lexical tones. These results provide strong neurophysiological evidence in support of categorical perception of lexical tones in Chinese. More important, they demonstrate that acoustic and phonological information is processed in parallel within the MMN time window for the perception of lexical tones. Finally, homologous nonspeech stimuli elicited similar MMN patterns, indicating that lexical tone knowledge influences the perception of nonspeech signals. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ma, WY; Zhou, P; Singh, L; Gao, LQ				Ma, Weiyi; Zhou, Peng; Singh, Leher; Gao, Liqun			Spoken word recognition in young tone language learners: Age-dependent effects of segmental and suprasegmental variation	COGNITION				Article								The majority of the world's languages rely on both segmental (vowels, consonants) and suprasegmental (lexical tones) information to contrast the meanings of individual words. However, research on early language development has mostly focused on the acquisition of vowel-consonant languages. Developmental research comparing sensitivity to segmental and suprasegmental features in young tone learners is extremely rare. This study examined 2- and 3-year-old monolingual tone learners' sensitivity to vowels and tones. Experiment la tested the influence of vowel and tone variation on novel word learning. Vowel and tone variation hindered word recognition efficiency in both age groups. However, tone variation hindered word recognition accuracy only in 2-year-olds, while 3-year-olds were insensitive to tone variation. Experiment 1b demonstrated that 3-year-olds could use tones to learn new words when additional support was provided, and additionally, that Tone 3 words were exceptionally difficult to learn. Experiment 2 confirmed a similar pattern of results when children were presented with familiar words. This study is the first to show that despite the importance of tones in tone languages, vowels maintain primacy over tones in young children's word recognition and that tone sensitivity in word learning and recognition changes between 2 and 3 years of age. The findings suggest that early lexical processes are more tightly constrained by variation in vowels than by tones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Soo, R; Babel, M				Soo, Rachel; Babel, Molly			Lexical competition, sound change, and language dominance in Cantonese tone category recognition	LABORATORY PHONOLOGY				Article								Speech perception can be shaped by factors such as lexical competition, synchronic variation , language dominance. Listeners can use lexical information to categorize sounds , recognize words, but systematic variation may act to neutralize lexical contrasts. Additionally, the detail in the phonological-lexical representations may vary along with linguistic experience. We examine the confluence of these factors in the current study, examining how lexical competition structures phonetic variation of merging vs. non-merging tone categories in Cantonese-English bilinguals varying in relative Cantonese vs. English dominance. Listeners categorized tokens from lexical tone continua generated from minimal pairs (Experiment 1: Word identification) and from word-nonword pairs (Experiment 2: Lexical decision). When there are lexical competitors at both endpoints of the continua, listeners maintained more discrete categorization functions for non-merging tones than merging tones. In the absence of lexical competition, there was no difference in response functions for merging and non-merging tones at the group level. English -dominant early Cantonese-English bilinguals consistently showed less sigmoidal response functions compared to Cantonese-dominant early bilinguals in both experiments suggesting that lexical representations may be stored with less precise tonal detail by English-dominant Cantonese speakers. Overall, these data suggest that the presence of a lexical competitor constrains the range of acceptable phonetic variation for non-merging tones, while listeners are more accepting of phonetic variation in the merging tone categories.												3	3											APR 5	2023	14	1					1	38		10.16995/labphon.6448	http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/labphon.6448												2026-01-16	WOS:000968267700001
J	Yeung, HH; Chen, KH; Werker, JF				Yeung, H. Henny; Chen, Ke Heng; Werker, Janet F.			When does native language input affect phonetic perception? The precocious case of lexical tone	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE				Article								Previous studies have suggested that the perception of vowels and consonants changes from language-universal to language-specific between 6 and 12 months of age. This report suggests that language-specific perception emerges even earlier for lexical tones. Experiment 1 tested English-learners' perception of Cantonese tones, replicating declines in tone discrimination from 4 to 9 months of age. Experiment 2 tested infants learning non-native versus native tone systems (Mandarin-learners versus Cantonese-learners). All Chinese-learners discriminated the tones, but showed language-specific differences in tone preferences at both ages. Indeed, English-, Mandarin-, and Cantonese-learning 4-month-olds all exhibited distinct preferences. With other work, this shows that language-specific speech perception emerges over a more complex and extended schedule than previously thought: first for lexical stress aid tone (<5 months), then vowels (6-8 months), consonants (8.5-12 months), and finally phoneme duration (18 months). Acoustic salience likely plays an important role in determining the timing of phonetic development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty American listeners with no tone language background and 20 Chinese listeners were asked to identify dichotically presented tone pairs by identifying which tone they heard in each ear. For the Chinese listeners, 57% of the total errors occurred via the left ear. indicating a significant right ear advantage. However, the American listeners revealed no significant ear preference. with 48% of the errors attributable to the left ear. These results indicated that Mandarin tones are predominantly processed in the left hemisphere by native Mandarin speakers, whereas they are bilaterally processed by American English speakers with no prior tone experience. The results also suggest that the left hemisphere superiority for native Mandarin tone processing is similar to native processing of other tone languages.

J	Wiener, S; Ito, K				Wiener, Seth; Ito, Kiwako			Do syllable-specific tonal probabilities guide lexical access? Evidence from Mandarin, Shanghai and Cantonese speakers	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								An eye-tracking study investigated how the interaction between syllable frequency and syllable-specific tonal probability guides online lexical access in speakers of mutually unintelligible Chinese dialects with three disparate tonal systems. Mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers, bi-dialectal Shanghai-Mandarin speakers and bi-dialectal Cantonese-Mandarin speakers searched for target Mandarin syllable-tone combinations while their eye movements and mouse clicks were recorded. The results showed dialectal differences in online eye fixation patterns but not in offline mouse responses. For all groups, mouse clicks were fastest for infrequent syllables with most probable tones and slowest for infrequent syllables with least probable tones. In online eye movement responses, only mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers showed an interaction between syllable frequency and tonal probability. Mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers' fixations were fastest for infrequent syllables with probable tones and slowest for infrequent syllables with improbable tones. Mono-dialectal speakers also showed a greater amount of competition from the more probable segmental competitor when hearing improbable tones. Bi-dialectal speakers showed different timing in their integration of tonal probabilities. These findings suggest that highly bilingual speakers track and use Mandarin tonal probabilities, but their sensitivity to L2 tonal information may lag behind monolinguals for online word recognition.												30	38											OCT 21	2015	30	9			SI		1048	1060		10.1080/23273798.2014.946934	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2014.946934												2026-01-16	WOS:000362948700003
J	Zhao, R; Jiao, L; Wang, M; Wei, H				Zhao, Rong; Jiao, Lu; Wang, Min; Wei, Hang			The influence of L2 experience on L1 speech perception: Evidence from Mandarin-English bilinguals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUALISM				Article								Aims: Previous studies have documented that consonants contribute more to lexically related processes than vowels in English, whereas an opposite pattern occurs in Mandarin Chinese processing. The current study aims to examine how the long-term learning of English (L2) influences Mandarin (L1) consonant, vowel, and tone perception in bilingual adults. It also attempts to examine the multi-competence theory at the level of speech perception. Methodology: A total of 73 Mandarin-English bilinguals with different L2 proficiency levels performed the L1 syllable perception task in an active oddball paradigm. The deviant syllables differed from the standard in consonant, vowel, or tone. Participants were asked to press a button whenever they heard a different syllable. Data and analysis: The reaction time and accuracy of each deviant syllable were recorded by E-prime 2.0. These data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Findings/conclusions: Results showed that the relative role of vowel was the strongest, followed by consonant, and then by tone in L1 speech perception. The pattern of their relative roles/phonological bias was not influenced by L2 proficiency, indicating that the phonological bias in L1 speech perception is not affected by a transfer from non-native to native processing, but determined by the acoustic/phonological cues and lexical information carried by consonant, vowel, and tone. However, the perceptual sensitivity to L1 speech increased with L2 proficiency, demonstrating a positive L2 effect on L1 at the level of speech perception. Originality: The current study first investigated the influence of L2 experience on L1 phonological bias in bilinguals whose first and second languages were typologically distant. Significance/implications: Our findings lend support to the multi-competence theory and extend it to the level of speech perception.												2	3											OCT	2023	27	5					533	547	13670069221104964	10.1177/13670069221104964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13670069221104964		JUN 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000814979000001

Currently, there is still a lack of understanding of sensitivity to F0 change in CI users who speak tonal languages. In the present study, just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of F0 contour and F0 level changes in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs were measured and compared with those in their age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Results showed that children with CIs demonstrated significantly larger JND of F0 contour (JND-C) change and F0 level (JND-L) change compared to NH children. Further within-group comparison revealed that the JND-C change was significantly smaller than the JND-L change among children with CIs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among NH children. No significant correlations were seen between JND-C change/JND-L change and age at implantation /duration of CI use. The contrast between children with CIs and NH children in sensitivity to F0 contour and F0 level change suggests different mechanisms of F0 processing in these two groups as a result of different hearing experiences.												3	4											APR	2022	12	4							443	10.3390/brainsci12040443	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12040443												2026-01-16	WOS:000785521700001

Identification of Acoustically Modified Mandarin Tones by Non-native Listeners	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study investigated identification of fragmented Mandarin tones by non-native listeners. Monosyllabic Mandarin words were digitally processed to generate intact, silent-center, center-only, and onset-only syllables. The syllables were recorded with two carrier phrases such that the offset of the carrier tone and the onset of the target tone were either continuous or discontinuous in fundamental frequency (F0). The syllables were presented with an original carrier phrase, excised from the carrier phrase, or excised and cross-spliced with another carrier phrase. Response accuracy and reaction time were measured, and tone confusion patterns were analyzed. Overall, tone identification varied as a function of modification and tone. Intact and center-only syllables were identified more accurately than silent-center and onset-only syllables. Tone 2 was consistently the most challenging tone to identify. Although the performance level of the third-year students approached that of native listeners reported in Lee, Tao, and Bond (2008), the non-native listeners did not show evidence of using coarticulatory information. Nonetheless, the continuity or discontinuity in F0 between the carrier and target tones did affect tone identification, suggesting the influence of context in non-native tone identification.												19	36												2010	53		2				217	243		10.1177/0023830909357160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830909357160												2026-01-16	WOS:000278846800003

To date, however, the phonological deficits involved in schizophrenia in Chinese and its neural basis have not been well established. In order to establish such a relationship we conducted a behavioral study using lexical tone judgment and digit span tasks as well as an event-related potential (ERP) study with an auditory oddball paradigm, in particular, for P300 effects, the event related brain potential (ERP) index of discrimination. Chinese patients with schizophrenia and Chinese healthy controls in China participated in the current study. Compared to the healthy controls, the patients with schizophrenia showed significant impairments in phonological processing skills, which in turn significantly correlated with smaller P300 effects. Thus these behavioral and electrophysiological findings in Chinese patients with schizophrenia were critically evaluated in terms of their phonological processing abilities.												4	5											MAR 30	2017	261						65	71		10.1016/j.pscychresns.2017.01.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2017.01.004												2026-01-16	WOS:000395958900008

Pitch Perception in Tone Language-Speaking Adults With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorders	I-PERCEPTION				Article								Enhanced low-level pitch perception has been universally reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study examined whether tone language speakers with ASD exhibit this advantage. The pitch perception skill of 20 Cantonese-speaking adults with ASD was compared with that of 20 neurotypical individuals. Participants discriminated pairs of real syllable, pseudo-syllable (syllables that do not conform the phonotactic rules or are accidental gaps), and non-speech (syllables with attenuated high-frequency segmental content) stimuli contrasting pitch levels. The results revealed significantly higher discrimination ability in both groups for the non-speech stimuli than for the pseudo-syllables with one semitone difference. No significant group differences were noted. Different from previous findings, post hoc analysis found that enhanced pitch perception was observed in a subgroup of participants with ASD showing no history of delayed speech onset. The tone language experience may have modulated the pitch processing mechanism in the speakers in both ASD and non-ASD groups.												16	16											JUN 5	2017	8	3							2041669517711200	10.1177/2041669517711200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2041669517711200												2026-01-16	WOS:000402800100001

Segmental and suprasegmental features in speech perception in Cantonese-speaking second graders: An ERP study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY				Article								Using a multiple-deviant oddball paradigm, this study examined second graders' brain responses to Cantonese speech. We aimed to address the question of whether a change in a consonant or lexical tone could be automatically detected by children. We measured auditory mismatch responses to place of articulation and voice onset time (VOT), reflecting segmental perception, as well as Cantonese lexical tones including level tone and contour tone, reflecting suprasegmental perception. The data showed that robust mismatch negativities (MMNs) were elicited by all deviants in the time window of 300-500ms in second graders. Moreover, relative to the standard stimuli, the VOT deviant elicited a robust positive mismatch response, and the level tone deviant elicited a significant MMN in the time window of 150-300ms. The findings suggest that Hong Kong second graders were sensitive to neural discriminations of speech sounds both at the segmental and suprasegmental levels.												12	14											NOV	2014	51	11					1158	1168		10.1111/psyp.12257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/psyp.12257												2026-01-16	WOS:000343815200011

We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) for changes in duration and in Chinese lexical tone in a repeated vowel /a/ in native speakers of Finnish and Chinese in passive and active listening conditions. ERP amplitudes reflecting deviance detection (mismatch negativity; MMN and N2b) and attentional shifts towards changes in speech sounds (P3a and P3b) were investigated. In the passive listening condition, duration changes elicited increased amplitude in the MMN latency window for both standard and deviant sounds in the Finnish speakers compared to the Chinese speakers, but no group differences were observed for P3a. In passive listening to lexical tones, P3a was increased in amplitude for both standard and deviant stimuli in Chinese speakers compared to Finnish speakers, but the groups did not differ in MMN. In active listening, both tone and duration changes elicited N2b and P3b, but the groups differed only in pattern of results for the deviant type. The results thus suggest an overall increased sensitivity to native speech sounds, especially in passive listening, while the mechanisms of change detection and attentional shifting seem to work well for both native and non-native speech sounds in the attentive mode.												1	1											AUG 13	2024	201								108936	10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2024.108936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2024.108936		JUN 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001349054400001

Although the predominant role of the left AF in speech development is relatively clear, how the AF engages in music development is not understood. Congenital amusia is a special neurodevelopmental condition, which not only affects musical pitch but also speech tone processing. Using diffusion tensor tractography, we aimed at understanding the role of AF in music and speech processing by examining the neural connectivity characteristics of the bilateral AF among thirty Mandarin amusics. Compared to age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched controls, amusics demonstrated increased connectivity as reflected by the increased fractional anisotropy in the right posterior AF but decreased connectivity as reflected by the decreased volume in the right anterior AF. Moreover, greater fractional anisotropy in the left direct AF was correlated with worse performance in speech tone perception among amusics. This study is the first to examine the neural connectivity of AF in the neurodevelopmental condition of amusia as a result of disrupted music pitch and speech tone processing. We found abnormal white matter structural connectivity in the right AF for the amusic individuals. Moreover, we demonstrated that the white matter microstructural properties of the left direct AF is modulated by lexical tone deficits among the amusic individuals. These data support the notion of distinctive pitch processing systems between music and speech.												20	23											MAY	2018	223	4					2013	2024		10.1007/s00429-018-1608-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00429-018-1608-2												2026-01-16	WOS:000429200400028
J	Li, XL; Zhang, XC; Gong, Q				Li, Xiaolin; Zhang, Xiaochen; Gong, Qin			Evidence of both brainstem and auditory cortex involvement in categorical perception for Chinese lexical tones	NEUROREPORT				Review								The categorical perception of lexical tones is important to understand tonal languages. Recent studies have provided electrophysiological evidence for the categorical perception of lexical tones at the cortical level; however, whether neural correlates exist at subcortical levels remain unknown. In this study, by using across-category and within-category lexical tone contrasts with the equivalent physical interval, we recorded deviance detection activities at both the brainstem (reflected by frequency following response) and cortical levels (reflected by mismatch negativity) simultaneously. We found that significantly enhanced intertrial phase-locking of frequency following response s was observed only during the across-category deviance detection, which indicates that phonological differences could be detected at the level of brainstem. In addition, the across-category deviants induced stronger mismatch negativity than within-category deviants. For the first time, our results demonstrate that neural correlates of categorical perception of lexical tones exist even in the brainstem, and suggests that both cortical and subcortical processes are involved in the coding and categorization of tonal information.												5	5											MAR 4	2020	31	4					359	364		10.1097/WNR.0000000000001414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0000000000001414												2026-01-16	WOS:000528909300013
J	Liu, LQ; Kager, R				Liu, Liquan; Kager, Rene			Statistical learning of speech sounds is most robust during the period of perceptual attunement	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Although statistical learning has been shown to be a domain general mechanism, its constraints, such as its interactions with perceptual development, are less well understood and discussed. This study is among the first to investigate the distributional learning of lexical pitch in non-tone-language-learning infants, exploring its interaction with language-specific perceptual attunement during the first 2 years after birth. A total of 88 normally developing Dutch infants of 5, 11, and 14 months were tested via a distributional learning paradigm and were familiarized on a unimodal or bimodal distribution of high-level versus high-falling tones in Mandarin Chinese. After familiarization, they were tested on a tonal contrast that shared equal distributional information in either modality. At 5 months, infants in both conditions discriminated the contrast, whereas 11-month-olds showed discrimination only in the bimodal condition. By 14 months, infants failed to discriminate the contrast in either condition. Results indicate interplay between infants' long-term linguistic experience throughout development and short-term distributional learning during the experiment, and they suggest that the influence of tonal distributional learning varies along the perceptual attunement trajectory, such that opportunities for distributional learning effects appear to be constrained in the beginning and at the end of perceptual attunement. The current study contributes to previous research by demonstrating an effect of age on learning from distributional cues. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J	Sugiyama, Y				Sugiyama, Yukiko			Identification of Minimal Pairs of Japanese Pitch Accent in Noise-Vocoded Speech	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								The perception of lexical pitch accent in Japanese was assessed using noise-excited vocoder speech, which contained no fundamental frequency (f(o)) or its harmonics. While prosodic information such as in lexical stress in English and lexical tone in Mandarin Chinese is known to be encoded in multiple acoustic dimensions, such multidimensionality is less understood for lexical pitch accent in Japanese. In the present study, listeners were tested under four different conditions to investigate the contribution of non-f(o) properties to the perception of Japanese pitch accent: noise-vocoded speech stimuli consisting of 10 3-ERBN-wide bands and 15 2-ERBN-wide bands created from a male and female speaker. Results found listeners were able to identify minimal pairs of final-accented and unaccented words at a rate better than chance in all conditions, indicating the presence of secondary cues to Japanese pitch accent. Subsequent analyses were conducted to investigate if the listeners' ability to distinguish minimal pairs was correlated with duration, intensity or formant information. The results found no strong or consistent correlation, suggesting the possibility that listeners used different cues depending on the information available in the stimuli. Furthermore, the comparison of the current results with equivalent studies in English and Mandarin Chinese suggest that, although lexical prosodic information exists in multiple acoustic dimensions in Japanese, the primary cue is more salient than in other languages.												3	4											MAY 31	2022	13								887761	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.887761	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.887761												2026-01-16	WOS:000811337100001

This study examined modifications in infant-directed speech (IDS) and foreigner-directed speech (FDS) in Standard Mandarin-a tonal language-and explored how IDS and FDS features were manifested in disyllabic words and a longer discourse. The study aimed to determine which characteristics of IDS and FDS were enhanced in comparison with adult-directed speech (ADS), and how IDS and FDS differed when measured in a common set of acoustic parameters. For words, it was found that tone-bearing vowel duration, mean and range of fundamental frequency (F0), and the lexical tone contours were enhanced in IDS and FDS relative to ADS, except for the dipping Tone 3 that exhibited an unexpected lowering in FDS, but no modification in IDS when compared with ADS. For the discourse, different aspects of temporal and F0 enhancements were emphasized in IDS and FDS: the mean F0 was higher in IDS whereas the total discourse duration was greater in FDS. These findings add to the growing literature on L1 and L2 speech input characteristics and their role in language acquisition.												0	0											JUN	2024	155	6					3877	3888		10.1121/10.0026359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0026359												2026-01-16	WOS:001250074800003
J	DiCanio, C; Benn, J; García, RC				DiCanio, Christian; Benn, Joshua; Castillo Garcia, Rey			The phonetics of information structure in Yoloxochitl Mixtec	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Research on speech prosody has shown that higher-level phonological constituents can be examined directly via their influence on low level phonetic processes (Beckman & Edwards, 1990; Fougeron & Keating, 1997). Despite the strong tradition of research in this area, the existing work has focused mainly on languages which lack lexical tone. This contributes to the view that prosodic structures show little influence on tone, i.e. a language may either have lexical tone or lexical/phrasal stress, the latter of which fits into the prosodic hierarchy. The current paper examines prosodic focus in Yoloxochitl Mixtec, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in Mexico. Using experimental data from ten speakers in the field, we investigated how sentence position, stress, and focus type influenced the realization of F-o and duration in different tonal melodies. The findings show that the tonal F-o space was expanded and raised on words produced with contrastive focus, less on words produced with narrow focus, and least on words produced under broad, sentential focus. Focus-related lengthening asymmetrically affected stressed syllables in the language more than unstressed syllables. In stressed syllables, this resulted in an increase in tonal hyperarticulation.

In this study, we investigated the occurrence of categorical perception deficit in Mandarin lexical tones in Chinese children with dyslexia. Methods: Both behavioral and electrophysiological measures were taken to compare Chinese dyslexic children with age-matched controls. Auditory event-related potentials were collected with a passive listening oddball paradigm. Results: Behavioral data showed that dyslexic children perceived lexical tone contrasts less categorically and less precisely than age-matched controls. Consistent with the behavioral data, the across-category tone contrast elicited larger mismatch negativity than the within-category distinction in the left hemisphere for the age-matched controls but not for the dyslexic children. Conclusion: The behavioral and electrophysiological results demonstrate impaired categorical perception of lexical tones in Chinese children with dyslexia. Our findings support the hypothesis that children affected by dyslexia have a general deficit in categorical perception of speech, which generalizes to nonalphabetic languages at the suprasegmental level.												82	95											AUG	2012	53	8					874	882		10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02528.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02528.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000306310200009

Here, we performed an electroencephalography study to portray this brain dynamics of speech perception in CI children. We presented a Mandarin Chinese monosyllable or four-syllable idiom to CI and NH children, and infrequently varied its lexical tone to form a novel monosyllable or pseudo idiom in an oddball paradigm. The tone contrast embedded in the monosyllables evoked similar mismatch negativities (MMNs) in CI and NH children at an early stage (similar to 200 ms). However, the amplitude of the MMN evoked by the tone contrast in the idiom context was significantly lower in CI children than in NH children. Furthermore, robust late discriminative negativity (LDN) at a late stage (500 ms) was found only in NH children, but not in CI children. The MMN and LDN findings indicate deficits of low-level acoustic encoding in a complex context (such as an idiom) and higher-level cognitive processing in CI children, respectively. Both deficient sensory and cognitive processing may contribute to the speech perception difficulties in CI children. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	Smith, D; Burnham, D				Smith, Damien; Burnham, Denis			Faciliation of Mandarin tone perception by visual speech in clear and degraded audio: Implications for cochlear implants	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Cochlear implant (CI) users in tone language environments report great difficulty in perceiving lexical tone. This study investigated the augmentation of simulated cochlear implant audio by visual (facial) speech information for tone. Native speakers of Mandarin and Australian English were asked to discriminate between minimal pairs of Mandarin tones in five conditions: Auditory-Only, Auditory-Visual, CI-simulated Auditory-Only, CI-simulated Auditory-Visual, and Visual-Only (silent video). Discrimination in CI-simulated audio conditions was poor compared with normal audio, and varied according to tone pair, with tone pairs with strong non-F0 cues discriminated the most easily. The availability of visual speech information also improved discrimination in the CI-simulated audio conditions, particularly on tone pairs with strong durational cues. In the silent Visual-Only condition, both Mandarin and Australian English speakers discriminated tones above chance levels. Interestingly, tone-naive listeners outperformed native listeners in the Visual-Only condition, suggesting firstly that visual speech information for tone is available, and may in fact be under-used by normal-hearing tone language perceivers, and secondly that the perception of such information may be language-general, rather than the product of language-specific learning. This may find application in the development of methods to improve tone perception in CI users in tone language environments. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

However, virtually nothing is known about how synaesthetic colouring might operate in non-alphabetic systems. The current study shows how synaesthetic speakers of Mandarin Chinese come to colour the logographic units of their language. Both native and non-native Chinese speakers experienced synaesthetic colours for characters, and for words spelled in the Chinese spelling systems of Pinyin and Bopomo. We assessed the influences of lexical tone and Pinyin/Bopomo spelling and showed that synaesthetic colours are assigned to Chinese words in a non-random fashion. Our data show that Chinese-speaking synaesthetes with very different native languages can exhibit both differences and similarities in the ways in which they come to colour their Chinese words.

J	DiCanio, CT				DiCanio, Christian T.			Cross-linguistic perception of Itunyoso Trique tone	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Recent findings have argued in favor of the categorical perception of tonal contrasts in Taiwanese Mandarin and Standard Mandarin (Halle, Chang, & Best, 2004; Xu, Gandour, & Francis, 2006), and most recently in Mandarin and Cantonese (Peng et al., 2010). Findings in favor of the categorical perception of tone emerge most clearly from cross-linguistic Work on speech perception. The current study continues this line of research by investigating the categorical perception of Itunyoso Trique tone among Trique and French listeners. Tonal stimuli were presented to listeners in an AXB discrimination task (2AFC) and an AXB identification task (2AFC), closely following methods used in Halle et al. (2004). Evidence for a listener sensitivity to tonal categories was found for Trique listeners in their discrimination performance, but this pattern did not correspond to the identification performance. Overall, French speakers performed better overall at tone discrimination than Trique listeners, who largely ignored within-category phonetic differences. Both Trique and French listeners were found to be sensitive to psychoacoustic differences between stimuli, though French speakers relied more heavily on such differences. The findings here argue for the importance of both phonetic and auditory memory for the perception of Trique lexical tone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Baseline performance was only slightly above chance, although there appeared to be some visual information in the speakers' neck and head movements. When participants were taught to use this visible information in two experiments, visual tone identification improved significantly.

From a sample of 124 Chinese-English second graders, we identified 18 poor comprehenders (six Chinese, six English, and six in both Chinese and English). We matched these with six average comprehenders of comparable age and word reading abilities. Multivariate analysis of covariance and univariate F tests revealed that poor Chinese comprehenders and poor English comprehenders had significantly lower levels of Chinese lexical tone awareness than average readers even after controlling for nonverbal intelligence. No significant differences emerged on scores for segmental phonological awareness and vocabulary knowledge, either in Chinese and English or on English lexical stress sensitivity. These findings were discussed in relation to the universal view of reading, cross language prosodic transfer and the simple view of reading.												26	31											MAY	2017	40	2			SI		184	198		10.1111/1467-9817.12077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9817.12077												2026-01-16	WOS:000399331100006

Training stimuli consisted of either speech from one talker or speech from four talkers. Participants were either never instructed or explicitly taught associations between phonemes (CVs), tones, and nonce symbols across four consecutive days. Learning was assessed by the accuracy of mouse clicks and eye movements to visual nonce symbols. Critical trials induced competition between the target symbol, which matched the acoustic input, and a competitor symbol that had a statistically more probable tone (but mismatched the acoustic input). Eye fixations indicated that participants were sensitive to syllable-tone co-occurrence probabilities even without explicit instruction of tone. The degree to which statistical knowledge was used to recognize words appeared to increase when participants processed more variable speech.												13	14											MAR	2021	43	1					155	180	PII S0272263120000418	10.1017/S0272263120000418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000418												2026-01-16	WOS:000640665400007

With nearly 20% of the world's population, China has focused on economic development and health awareness to improve the care for its hearing-impaired population. Recently, the Chinese government has initiated national programs such as the China Disabled Persons Federation to fund prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of hearing impairment. Newborn hearing screening and auditory rehabilitation programs in China have expanded exponentially with government support. While facing many challenges and overcoming obstacles, cochlear implantation (CI) programs in China have also experienced considerable growth. This review discusses the implementation of CI programs for HL in China and presents current HL data including epidemiology, newborn hearing screening, and determination of genetic etiologies. Sharing the experience in Chinese auditory rehabilitation and CI programs will shine a light on the developmental pathway of healthcare infrastructure to meet emerging needs of the hearing-impaired population in other developing countries.												40	49											NOV-DEC	2017	38	6					647	652		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000441												2026-01-16	WOS:000423077800010

Analysis of a folk song sung by five singers reveals consistent realization of falling tones with a descending pitch within individual notes. The result suggests that Chaozhou singers may incorporate their spoken language experience into the notes they sing, irrespective of the different routes of learning to sing the song. Additionally, the realization of the phonetic distinctions of the language may also reflect an effort to delineate cultural boundaries and assert a cultural identity of Chaozhou.												0	0											SPR-SUM	2024	68	2					247	275															2026-01-16	WOS:001283276300003

Previous research using a prototype of the strategy demonstrated significant benefits in musical pitch and lexical tone discrimination tasks with no degradation in speech recognition when compared with the clinical Advanced Combination Encoder (ACE) strategy in a small group of subjects. Based on those studies, a modified version of the strategy was implemented in the commercial Nucleus CP900 series processor. The aims of the present study were to establish whether the CP900 OPAL implementation continued to provide improved F0 pitch perception in a speech intonation task with no degradation to speech perception in quiet and noise, when compared with the clinical ACE strategy in a larger cohort of subjects. Further aims were to evaluate fitting procedures and subject acclimatization to the strategy after take-home experience. Design: Twenty experienced adult cochlear implant recipients were enrolled in the study. Two subjects withdrew during the study leaving 18 sets of data for analysis. A repeated-measures single-subject design with take-home experience was used to test for improved speech intonation perception using OPAL compared with ACE and for comparable performance between strategies for open-set word recognition in quiet at two presentation levels, sentence recognition in adaptive 4-talker babble noise, and speech intelligibility ratings. The stimulation rate employed for OPAL was 1200 pulses per second/channel which was higher than the default clinical rate of 900 pulses per second/channel used for ACE by all subjects in the present study. Two variations of the OPAL "F0 restore gain" (the gain applied to restore the loudness of modulated channels) were investigated: "custom" measured per subject and "default" which was the average of all subject custom gains. Results: A significant group mean benefit on the intonation test of 8.5% points was shown for OPAL compared with ACE. There was a significant period of adaptation to OPAL with significantly poorer sentence in noise scores acutely and after only 2 weeks of take-home experience. After 4 weeks of take-home experience, comparable word perception in quiet and sentence perception in noise for OPAL were obtained. Furthermore, there was good subject acceptability in the field with comparable speech intelligibility ratings between strategies. Results of the fitting procedure showed that OPAL did not require any additional steps compared with fitting of ACE. A default F0 restore gain provided comparable outcomes to a custom gain setting. Conclusions: The CP900 OPAL implementation provided a significant benefit to perception of speech intonation when compared with ACE. Comparable speech perception (in quiet and noise) and subjective ratings of speech intelligibility between strategies were also achieved after a period of acclimatization. These outcomes are consistent with results of earlier studies using prototype versions of the strategy and reaffirm its potential for improvement of F0 pitch perception in speech while preserving coding of segmental speech information. Furthermore, the OPAL strategy can be programmed into subject's processors using the same fitting procedures used for ACE thereby simplifying its adoption in clinical settings.												18	18											MAY-JUN	2019	40	3					555	567		10.1097/AUD.0000000000000627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000627												2026-01-16	WOS:000466796000011
J	Frota, S; Butler, J; Vigário, M				Frota, Sonia; Butler, Joseph; Vigario, Marina			Infants' Perception of Intonation: Is It a Statement or a Question?	INFANCY				Article								The ability to distinguish phonetic variations in speech that are relevant to meaning is essential for infants' language development. Previous studies into the acquisition of prosodic categories have focused on lexical stress, lexical pitch accent, or lexical tone. However, very little is known about the developmental course of infants' perception of linguistic intonation. In this study, we investigate infants' perception of the correlates of the statement/yes-no question contrast in a language that marks this sentence type distinction only by prosodic means, European Portuguese (EP). Using a modified version of the visual habituation paradigm, EP-learning infants at 5-6 and 8-9months were able to successfully discriminate segmentally varied, single-prosodic word intonational phrases presented with statement or yes-no question intonation, demonstrating that they are sensitive to the prosodic cues marking this distinction as early as 5months and maintain this sensitivity throughout the first year. These results suggest the presence of precocious discrimination abilities for intonation across segmental variation, similarly to previous reports for lexical pitch accent, but unlike previous findings for word stress.												52	62											MAR	2014	19	2					194	213		10.1111/infa.12037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12037												2026-01-16	WOS:000329924700005
J	Kadyamusuma, MR				Kadyamusuma, McLoddy R.			Effect of linguistic experience on the discrimination of Shona lexical tone	SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES				Article								This article examines how experience with a tone language (Thai) and with pitch variations at the sentential level (German) influences the perception of a typologically different tone language (Shona). Tone perception in adults is influenced by experience with the phonological inventory of one's native language. However, the extant data demonstrates that good to ceiling performance on tone perception is not restricted to tone language listeners. To this effect tone perceptual discrimination was investigated in experiment 1 using minimal pairs of Shona words and their filtered homologues, whereas experiment 2 tested the effect of increasing the number of phonetic contrasts using minimal and non-minimal pairs in Shona words and low-pass filtered stimuli. The results revealed that the Shona and Thai listeners discriminated both the Shona words and low-pass filtered stimuli significantly better than the non-tone listeners in both experiments. In experiment 2 it was also observed that although the accuracy performance of the tone language listeners is comparable, the types and pattern of errors committed are quite different.												3	3												2012	30	4					469	485		10.2989/16073614.2012.750821	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16073614.2012.750821												2026-01-16	WOS:000312721900003

A within-participant design (N= 72) was used to investigate discrimination of own- and other-race faces and native and non-native speech sounds in 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants. For face and speech discrimination, whereas 3-month-olds discriminated own-race faces and native speech sounds as well as other-race faces and non-native speech sounds, older infants discriminated only own-race faces and native speech sounds. Narrowing in face and narrowing in speech were not correlated at 6 months, negatively correlated at 9 months, and positively correlated at 12 months. The findings reveal dynamic developmental changes in the relation between modalities during the first year of life. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Plasticity in Second Language Learning: The Case of Mandarin Tones	LANGUAGE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT				Article								Adults typically struggle to perceive non-native sound contrasts, especially those that conflict with their first language. Do the same challenges persist when the sound contrasts overlap but do not conflict? To address this question, we explored the acquisition of lexical tones. While tonal variations are present in many languages, they are only used contrastively in tonal languages. We investigated the perception of Mandarin tones by adults with differing experience with Mandarin, including naive listeners, classroom learners, and native speakers. Naive listeners discriminated Mandarin tones at above-chance levels, and performance significantly improved after just one month of classroom exposure. Additional evidence for plasticity came from advanced classroom learners, whose tonemic perception was indistinguishable from that of native speakers. The results suggest that unlike many other non-native contrasts, adults studying a language in the classroom can readily acquire the perceptual skills needed to discriminate Mandarin tones.												8	8												2020	16	3					231	243		10.1080/15475441.2020.1737072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2020.1737072		MAR 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000525148900001

Potentially, both methods of segmentation can be used clinically. A majority of the Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant subjects could complete MHINT - with the more relaxed adaptive rules. The results make it possible to compare the performance of cochlear implant users across languages. Objectives: The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the modified adaptive scoring rules and to develop alternative methods of segmentations in MHINT that are suitable for the Chinese language. Methods: Thirty Mandarin-speaking normal-hearing adults were tested with MHINT using three adaptive rules based on character and/or word segmentation of the sentences. Twenty-three Mandarin-speaking post-lingually deafened cochlear implant patients were also recruited to participate in the testing. Results: There were no significant differences in the reception threshold for sentences and speech recognition scores obtained with either method of segmentation (p > 0.05). Fifteen of the 23 cochlear implant subjects (65%) could be tested with the modified adaptive scoring rules. The performance-intensity functions of the cochlear implant subjects were shifted at least 8-10 dB to higher signal-to-noise ratios as compared with those of the normal-hearing subjects.												9	11											JUL	2010	130	7					831	837		10.3109/00016480903493758	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00016480903493758												2026-01-16	WOS:000281619900013

E.; Desimone, Robert			Piano training enhances the neural processing of pitch and improves speech perception in Mandarin-speaking children	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				Article								Musical training confers advantages in speech-sound processing, which could play an important role in early childhood education. To understand the mechanisms of this effect, we used event-related potential and behavioral measures in a longitudinal design. Seventy-four Mandarin-speaking children aged 4-5 y old were pseudorandomly assigned to piano training, reading training, or a no-contact control group. Six months of piano training improved behavioral auditory word discrimination in general as well as word discrimination based on vowels compared with the controls. The reading group yielded similar trends. However, the piano group demonstrated unique advantages over the reading and control groups in consonant-based word discrimination and in enhanced positive mismatch responses (pMMRs) to lexical tone and musical pitch changes. The improved word discrimination based on consonants correlated with the enhancements in musical pitch pMMRs among the children in the piano group. In contrast, all three groups improved equally on general cognitive measures, including tests of IQ, working memory, and attention. The results suggest strengthened common sound processing across domains as an important mechanism underlying the benefits of musical training on language processing. In addition, although we failed to find far-transfer effects of musical training to general cognition, the near-transfer effects to speech perception establish the potential for musical training to help children improve their language skills. Piano training was not inferior to reading training on direct tests of language function, and it even seemed superior to reading training in enhancing consonant discrimination.												84	96											JUL 10	2018	115	28					E6630	E6639		10.1073/pnas.1808412115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1808412115												2026-01-16	WOS:000438050900030
J	Ling, CLK; Choi, W				Ling, Cheuk Lam Katie; Choi, William			Strings Versus Keys: A Comparison of Violinists, Pianists, and Nonmusicians in Lexical Tone Perception and Tone Word Learning	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Correlational research has found that musicians outperform nonmusicians in lexical tone perception and tone word learning. In these studies, participants were dichotomized as either musicians or nonmusicians. However, musicianship is nonbinary, as different musical instruments have different pitch processing demands. Examining different types of musicianship would enable a more comprehensive understanding of music-to-language transfer. The present study investigated whether violinists would outperform pianists and nonmusicians in discriminating and identifying Thai contour tones and, if so, whether the violinists' advantage in Thai contour tones would also apply to Thai tone word learning. Method: Eighty-one Cantonese violinists, pianists, and nonmusicians completed a Thai tone discrimination task, a Thai tone identification task, and seven sessions of tone word identification training. Participants also completed a working memory task, a nonverbal intelligence task, and an inhibitory control task. Results: In the Thai tone discrimination task, the violinists, pianists, and nonmusicians performed similarly. In the Thai tone identification task, the violinists and pianists performed similarly, but both groups outperformed the nonmusicians. In the Thai tone word learning task, both the violinists and the pianists outperformed the nonmusicians, with violinists demonstrating the largest musical advantage. Unexpectedly, the violinists' advantage applied to some but not all contour and level tones. Conclusions: The results indicated that music-to-language transfer in tone word learning hinges on the type of musical instrument. Theoretically, there is a need to introduce elements of higher level linguistic processing and selectivity into the Overlap, Precision, Emotion, Repetition, and Attention hypothesis. Practically, the study suggests the potential of violin training in facilitating nonnative tone word learning.												0	0											OCT	2025	68	10					4889	4916		10.1044/2025_JSLHR-25-00133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2025_JSLHR-25-00133												2026-01-16	WOS:001613747600021

Native language's influence on neural response to pitch in different domains	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								Language experience shapes musical and speech pitch processing. We investigated whether speaking a lexical tone language natively modulates neural processing of pitch in language and music as well as their correlation. We tested tone language (Mandarin Chinese), and non-tone language (Dutch) listeners in a passive oddball paradigm measuring mismatch negativity (MMN) for (i) Chinese lexical tones and (ii) three-note musical melodies with similar pitch contours. For lexical tones, Chinese listeners showed a later MMN peak than the non tone language listeners, whereas for MMN amplitude there were no significant differences between groups. Dutch participants also showed a late discriminative negativity (LDN). In the music condition two MMNs, corresponding to the two notes that differed between the standard and the deviant were found for both groups, and an LDN were found for both the Dutch and the Chinese listeners. The music MMNs were significantly right lateralized. Importantly, significant correlations were found between the lexical tone and the music MMNs for the Dutch but not the Chinese participants. The results suggest that speaking a tone language natively does not necessarily enhance neural responses to pitch either in language or in music, but that it does change the nature of neural pitch processing: non-tone language speakers appear to perceive lexical tones as musical, whereas for tone language speakers, lexical tones and music may activate different neural networks. Neural resources seem to be assigned differently for the lexical tones and for musical melodies, presumably depending on the presence or absence of long-term phonological memory traces.												23	27											MAY-JUL	2018	180						31	41		10.1016/j.bandl.2018.04.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2018.04.006												2026-01-16	WOS:000435528800005

J.; Diao, Mingfang; Li, Xiaodong; Zheng, Chengshi			Predicting the intelligibility of Mandarin Chinese with manipulated and intact tonal information for normal-hearing listeners	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Objective indices for predicting speech intelligibility offer a quick and convenient alternative to behavioral measures of speech intelligibility. However, most such indices are designed for a specific language, such as English, and they do not take adequate account of tonal information in speech when applied to languages like Mandarin Chinese (hereafter called Mandarin) for which the patterns of fundamental frequency (F0) variation play an important role in distinguishing speech sounds with similar phonetic content. To address this, two experiments with normal-hearing listeners were conducted examining: (1) The impact of manipulations of tonal information on the intelligibility of Mandarin sentences presented in speech-shaped noise (SSN) at several signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs); (2) The intelligibility of Mandarin sentences with intact tonal information presented in SSN, pink noise, and babble at several SNRs. The outcomes were not correctly predicted by the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI-V1). A new intelligibility metric was developed that used one acoustic feature from HASPI-V1 plus Hilbert time envelope and temporal fine structure information from multiple frequency bands. For the new metric, the Pearson correlation between obtained and predicted intelligibility was 0.923 and the root mean square error was 0.119. The new metric provides a potential tool for evaluating Mandarin intelligibility.												0	1											NOV	2024	156	5					3088	3101		10.1121/10.0034233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0034233												2026-01-16	WOS:001350704200001

However, the specific pathways by which it influences reading comprehension remain unclear. This study evaluates how prosodic sensitivity contributes to reading comprehension in both a first language (L1), Chinese, and a second language (L2), English, through segmental phonological awareness and morphological awareness among bilingual children in Hong Kong. Method: A group of 227 Hong Kong fourth graders was assessed on prosodic sensitivity, segmental phonological awareness, morphological awareness, vocabulary, word reading, and reading comprehension in both L1 and L2, as well as nonverbal intelligence and working memory. Results: Within-language structural equation modeling analyses revealed that Cantonese lexical tone awareness significantly contributed to Chinese word reading via morphological awareness, constituting a morpholexical pathway. Conversely, English prosodic sensitivity significantly contributed to English word reading through segmental phonological awareness, establishing a phonolexical pathway. Word reading within each language significantly predicted reading comprehension. The cross-language model further indicated that Cantonese lexical tone awareness contributed directly to English reading comprehension and indirectly through English phonological awareness and English word reading. In contrast, English prosodic sensitivity significantly contributed to Chinese reading comprehension through Chinese morphological awareness and Chinese word reading. Conclusions: The results underscore the primacy of suprasegmental elements in reading acquisition across languages, highlighting the pivotal roles of morphological awareness in Chinese and segmental phonological awareness in English. These findings suggest that intervention aimed at improving reading skills in bilinguals may consider the contributions of prosodic sensitivity across different linguistic contexts.

J	Ortega-Llebaria, M; Wu, ZH				Ortega-Llebaria, Marta; Wu, Zhaohong			Chinese-English Speakers' Perception of Pitch in Their Non-Tonal Language: Reinterpreting English as a Tonal-Like Language	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Changing the F0-contour of English words does not change their lexical meaning. However, it changes the meaning in tonal languages such as Mandarin. Given this important difference and knowing that words in the two languages of a bilingual lexicon interact, the question arises as to how Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in their bilingual lexicon. The few studies that addressed this question showed that Mandarin-English speakers did not perceive pitch in English words as native English speakers did. These studies, however, used English words as stimuli failing to examine nonwords and Mandarin words. Consequently, possible pre-lexical effects and L1 transfer were not ruled out. The present study fills this gap by examining pitch perception in Mandarin and English words and nonwords by Mandarin-English speakers and a group of native English controls. Results showed the tonal experience of Chinese-English speakers modulated their perception of pitch in their non-tonal language at both pre-lexical and lexical levels. In comparison to native English controls, tonal speakers were more sensitive to the acoustic salience of F0-contours in the pre-lexical processing due to top-down feedback. At the lexical level, Mandarin-English speakers organized words in their two languages according to similarity criteria based on both F0 and segmental information, whereas only the segmental information was relevant to the control group. These results in perception together with consistently reported production patterns in previous literature suggest that Mandarin-English speakers process pitch in English as if it was a one-tone language.												11	11											JUN	2021	64	2			SI		467	487	0023830919894606	10.1177/0023830919894606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830919894606		JAN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000507060400001

Better than native: Tone language experience enhances English lexical stress discrimination in Cantonese-English bilingual listeners	COGNITION				Article								While many second language (L2) listeners are known to struggle when discriminating non-native features absent in their first language (L1), no study has reported that L2 listeners perform better than native listeners in this regard. The present study tested whether Cantonese-English bilinguals were better in discriminating English lexical stress in individual words or pseudowords than native English listeners, even though lexical stress is absent in Cantonese. In experiments manipulating acoustic, phonotactic, and lexical cues, Cantonese-English bilingual adults exhibited superior performance in discriminating English lexical stress than native English listeners across all phonotactic/lexical conditions when the fundamental frequency (f0) cue to lexical stress was present. The findings underscore the facilitative effect of Cantonese tone language experience on English lexical stress discrimination.												28	31											AUG	2019	189						188	192		10.1016/j.cognition.2019.04.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2019.04.004												2026-01-16	WOS:000472693900018

Research on tone languages has typically investigated well-known tone languages such as Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese. The current study looked at a Limburgian dialect of Dutch that uses lexical pitch differences, albeit in a rather restricted way. Using a visual habituation paradigm, 6- to 12-month-old Limburgian and Dutch infants were tested for their ability to discriminate Limburgian tones. The results showed that both Limburgian and Dutch infants discriminate the Limburgian tones throughout their first year of life. The role of linguistic experience, acoustic salience, and the degree of similarity to the native prosodic system are discussed.												15	17											MAR	2018	45	2					290	318		10.1017/S0305000917000228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305000917000228												2026-01-16	WOS:000430739000002

Tone perception in cantonese-speaking children with hearing aids	ANNALS OF OTOLOGY RHINOLOGY AND LARYNGOLOGY				Article								Objectives: In this study we investigated the benefit of using hearing aids for Cantonese tone perception among children with various degrees of hearing impairment. Methods: Forty-eight children with moderate to profound hearing loss were investigated. They were required to perform a lexical tone perception test with recorded test stimuli presented at 65 dB in soundproof booths. To allow for comparison, the subjects performed the test under 2 conditions: with their hearing aids turned off (unaided condition) and with them turned on (aided condition). Results: The mean tone perception scores for the aided condition were higher than those for the unaided condition across all of the subject groups. Paired sample t-tests showed statistically significant improvement in tone perception in the moderate and severe hearing loss groups (p = .02 and p = .03, respectively). The result obtained from the moderately severe hearing loss group was marginally significant (p = .058). The improvement in tone perception in the profound hearing loss group was insignificant (p = .55). Conclusions: The use of a hearing aid is beneficial for Cantonese tone perception in children who have moderate to severe hearing impairment. When a hearing loss is greater than 90 dB, ie, in children who are classified as having profound hearing loss, a hearing aid is not effective in aiding Cantonese tone perception.												9	10											APR	2008	117	4					313	316		10.1177/000348940811700413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000348940811700413												2026-01-16	WOS:000254983500013

Materials and Methods: Four postlingually deafened Cantonese-speaking adults (2 men and 2 women) with bilateral Cis were included in this study. The subjects were their own control in the monaural hearing condition. Both the Cantonese lexical tone stimuli and the speech-weighted background noise were presented at 0degrees azimuth and at a distance of 1 m from the subject. The speech stimuli, which were maintained at 65 dB sound pressure level, were presented, in both a quiet environment and against a background noise at signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of +15, +10, +5, 0, -5, -10, and -15. Results: Against a background noise, the bilateral Cis required +5 dB SNR only to obtain significant scores in discriminating Cantonese lexical tones and to achieve discrimination scores that were comparable to the optimal discrimination scores obtained in quiet. No significant difference in the discrimination scores was observed between binaural and monaural hearing conditions when the tests were conducted in quiet. Conclusions: Our study showed that in the presence of background noise, bilateral Cis were better than unilateral Cis in discriminating Cantonese lexical tones.												12	14											JAN-FEB	2003	24	1					19	23		10.1053/ajot.2003.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/ajot.2003.8												2026-01-16	WOS:000181110800004

Flexibility in Bilingual Infants' Word Learning	CHILD DEVELOPMENT				Article								The present experiments tested bilingual infants' developmental narrowing for the interpretation of sounds that form words. These studies addressed how language specialization proceeds when the environment provides varied and divergent input. Experiment 1 (N=32) demonstrated that bilingual 14- and 19-month-olds learned a pair of object labels consisting of the same syllable produced with distinct pitch contours (rising and falling). Infants' native languages did not use pitch contour to differentiate words. In Experiment 2 (N=16), 22-month-old bilinguals failed to learn the labels. These results conflict with the developmental trajectory of monolinguals, who fail to learn pitch contour contrasts as labels at 17-19months (Hay, Graf Estes, Wang, & Saffran, 2015). Bilingual infants exhibited a prolonged period of flexibility in their interpretation of potential word forms.												58	67											SEP-OCT	2015	86	5					1371	1385		10.1111/cdev.12392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12392												2026-01-16	WOS:000361185700005

Early behavioral studies revealed that similar mechanisms underlie musical and lexical pitch perception in CI-based electric hearing. Although neurophysiological studies of the musical pitch perception of English-speaking CI users are actively ongoing, little such research has been conducted with Mandarin-speaking CI users; as Mandarin is a tonal language, these individuals require pitch information to understand speech. The aim of this work was to study the neurophysiological mechanisms accounting for the musical pitch identification abilities of Mandarin-speaking CI users and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Behavioral and mismatch negativity (MMN) data were analyzed to examine musical pitch processing performance. Moreover, neurophysiological results from CI users with good and bad pitch discrimination performance (according to the just-noticeable differences (JND) and pitch-direction discrimination (PDD) tasks) were compared to identify cortical responses associated with musical pitch perception differences. The MMN experiment was conducted using a passive oddball paradigm, with musical tone C4 (262 Hz) presented as the standard and tones D4 (294 Hz), E4 (330 Hz), G#4 (415 Hz), and C5 (523 Hz) presented as deviants. CI users demonstrated worse musical pitch discrimination ability than did NH listeners, as reflected by larger JND and PDD thresholds for pitch identification, and significantly increased latencies and reduced amplitudes in MMN responses. Good CI performers had better MMN results than did bad performers. Consistent with findings for English-speaking CI users, the results of this work suggest that MMN is a viable marker of cortical pitch perception in Mandarin-speaking CI users.												6	8											JUL 22	2020	2020								4576729	10.1155/2020/4576729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/4576729												2026-01-16	WOS:000559267000001

This belief is somewhat at odds with research that consistently shows beginning learners making quick gains through focused tone training, as well as research showing advanced learners achieving near-native performance in tone identification tasks. However, other long-term difficulties related to L2 tone perception may persist, given the additional demands of word recognition and the effects of context. In the current study, we used behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) experiments to test whether perception of Mandarin tones is difficult for advanced L2 learners in isolated syllables, disyllabic words in isolation, and disyllabic words in sentences. Stimuli were more naturalistic and challenging than in previous research. While L2 learners excelled at tone identification in isolated syllables, they performed with very low accuracy in rejecting disyllabic tonal nonwords in isolation and in sentences. We also report ERP data from critical mismatching words in sentences; while L2 listeners showed no significant differences in responses in any condition, trends were not inconsistent with the overall pattern in behavioral results of less sensitivity to tone mismatches than to semantic or segmental mismatches. We interpret these results as evidence that Mandarin tones are in fact difficult for advanced L2 learners. However, the difficulty is not due primarily to an inability to perceive tones phonetically, but instead is driven by the need to process tones lexically, especially in multisyllable words.												40	52											MAR	2019	41	1					59	86		10.1017/S0272263117000444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0272263117000444												2026-01-16	WOS:000478989000004
J	Deng, QL; Choi, W; Tong, XL				Deng, Qinli; Choi, William; Tong, Xiuli			Bidirectional Cross-Linguistic Association of Phonological Skills and Reading Comprehension: Evidence From Hong Kong Chinese-English Bilingual Readers	JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES				Article								This study examined the roles of first-language (L1) Chinese and second-language (L2) English phonological skills in English and Chinese reading comprehension, respectively, and their association with reading comprehension difficulties among Hong Kong Chinese-English bilingual children. We tested 258 second graders on nonverbal intelligence, working memory, phonological skills, word reading, and reading comprehension, in both Chinese and English. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that Chinese phonological skills contributed to English reading comprehension both directly and indirectly, through the mediation of English phonological skills and English word reading. In contrast, English phonological skills contributed only indirectly to Chinese reading comprehension through L1 Chinese phonological and word reading skills. Furthermore, poor Chinese readers, poor English readers, and poor readers in both Chinese and English exhibited lower levels of lexical tone awareness than average readers, even after controlling for nonverbal intelligence, word reading, and working memory. Poor Chinese readers outperformed poor English readers and poor readers in both Chinese and English on Chinese segmental phonological awareness, and their performance was comparable to average readers. These findings suggest that both suprasegmental and segmental phonological skills are critical to the development of reading comprehension across L1 Chinese and L2 English in Hong Kong Chinese-English bilingual children.												24	30											JUL	2019	52	4					299	311		10.1177/0022219419842914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022219419842914												2026-01-16	WOS:000471886900002
J	Chen, F; Peng, G				Chen, Fei; Peng, Gang			Context Effect in the Categorical Perception of Mandarin Tones	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY				Article								The categorical perception of tones is based not only on word-internal F0 cues but also on external F0 cues in the contexts. The present study focuses on the effects of different types of preceding contexts on Mandarin tone perception. In the experiment, subjects were required to identify a target tone with the preceding context. The target tone was from a tone continuum ranging from Mandarin Tone 1 (high-level tone) to Tone 2 (mid-rising tone). It was preceded by four types of contexts (normal speech, reversal speech, fine-structure sound, and non-speech) with different mean F0 values. Results indicate that the categorical perception of Mandarin tones is influenced only by the normal speech context, and the effect is contrastive. For instance, in a normal speech context with a higher mean F0, the following tone is more likely to be perceived as a lower frequency tone (Tone 2), whereas with a lower mean F0, the following tone is more likely to be perceived as a higher frequency tone (Tone 1). These findings suggest that Mandarin tone normalization is mediated by speech-specific processes and that the speech context needs to be intelligible.												15	17											FEB	2016	82	2					253	261		10.1007/s11265-015-1008-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11265-015-1008-2												2026-01-16	WOS:000371299700012

Voice Discrimination by Adults with Cochlear Implants: the Benefits of Early Implantation for Vocal-Tract Length Perception	JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY				Article								Cochlear implant (CI) users find it extremely difficult to discriminate between talkers, which may partially explain why they struggle to understand speech in a multi-talker environment. Recent studies, based on findings with postlingually deafened CI users, suggest that these difficulties may stem from their limited use of vocal-tract length (VTL) cues due to the degraded spectral resolution transmitted by the CI device. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of adult CI users who had no prior acoustic experience, i.e., prelingually deafened adults, to discriminate between resynthesized "talkers" based on either fundamental frequency (F0) cues, VTL cues, or both. Performance was compared to individuals with normal hearing (NH), listening either to degraded stimuli, using a noise-excited channel vocoder, or non-degraded stimuli. Results show that (a) age of implantation was associated with VTL but not F0 cues in discriminating between talkers, with improved discrimination for those subjects who were implanted at earlier age; (b) there was a positive relationship for the CI users between VTL discrimination and speech recognition score in quiet and in noise, but not with frequency discrimination or cognitive abilities; (c) early-implanted CI users showed similar voice discrimination ability as the NH adults who listened to vocoded stimuli. These data support the notion that voice discrimination is limited by the speech processing of the CI device. However, they also suggest that early implantation may facilitate sensory-driven tonotopicity and/or improve higher-order auditory functions, enabling better perception of VTL spectral cues for voice discrimination.												27	28											APR	2018	19	2					193	209		10.1007/s10162-017-0653-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10162-017-0653-5												2026-01-16	WOS:000428929300006
J	Gauthier, B; Shi, RS; Xu, Y				Gauthier, Bruno; Shi, Rushen; Xu, Yi			Learning Prosodic Focus from Continuous Speech Input: A Neural Network Exploration	LANGUAGE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT				Article								This study uses connectionist modeling to explore whether and how infants might learn prosodic focus directly from continuous speech input. Focus is a communicative function that serves to put emphasis on a particular part of an utterance, and it is mainly encoded by pitch variations. The acquisition of focus entails two major difficulties. The first is that focus-related pitch patterns are confounded by other linguistic functions that also use pitch for their encoding, such as lexical tone in a tone language. Second, speakers have different pitch ranges, which further confounds the focus related pitch patterns. In three simulations using self-organizing neural networks, we explored how focus may be learned from continuous acoustic signals in Mandarin that were produced with co-occurring lexical tones and by multiple speakers. We used sentence-sized F-0 contours as well as their velocity profiles (D-1) as training input. Results show that both F-0 and D-1 contours provide information for focus learning, but only the D-1-trained network adequately handled the variability introduced by cross-gender differences. The recognition rate was analogous to human performance. Implications of these findings for theories of language acquisition and adult speech perception are discussed.												4	5												2009	5	2					94	114		10.1080/15475440802698524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475440802698524												2026-01-16	WOS:000212551100002
J	Wright, J; Baese-Berk, M				Wright, Jonathan; Baese-Berk, Melissa			The impact of phonotactic features on novel tone discrimination	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Many studies have examined novel tone perception, but few have investigated the interaction between novel tone perception ability and phonotactic structure. We examined the discrimination of Thai low and mid tones by native Mandarin and native English participants across four syllable types (CCVV, CVV, VV, hums) to test the interaction between first language suprasegmental experience and phonotactic complexity on novel tone discrimination. We also tested the impact of unfamiliar consonant clusters and unfamiliar segments in the onset. Across syllable types, native Mandarin participants discriminated tones better than native English speakers. Further, discrimination ability was not impacted by phonotactic complexity. However, unfamiliar syllable structure impacted discrimination ability for native Mandarin participants in an unintuitive way. They discriminated tones significantly better in CCVV syllables. Unfamiliar segments in the onset, however, had a negative impact on tone discrimination. The presence of /eta/ onsets, which are illegal in English and allophonically permitted in Mandarin, significantly reduced tone discrimination accuracy. For native English participants, /eta/ onsets resulted in no discrimination between tones. These results suggest that the phonotactic structure of carrier words for tones interacts with L1 phonotactic experience in modulating novel tone perception ability. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Malins, JG; Joanisse, MF				Malins, Jeffrey G.; Joanisse, Marc F.			Setting the tone: An ERP investigation of the influences of phonological similarity on spoken word recognition in Mandarin Chinese	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								We investigated the influences of phonological similarity on the time course of spoken word processing in Mandarin Chinese. Event related potentials were recorded while adult native speakers of Mandarin (N=19) judged whether auditory,words matched or mismatched visually presented pictures. Mismatching words were of the following nature: segmental (e.g., picture: hua1 'flower'; sound: hua4 'painting'); cohort (e.g., picture: hua1 'flower'; sound: hui1 'gray'); rhyme (e.g., picture: hua1 'flower'; sound: gua1 'melon'); tonal (e.g., picture: hua1 'flower': sound: jing1 'whale'); unrelated (e.g., picture: hua1 'flower'; sound: lang2 'wolf'). Expectancy violations in the segmental condition showed an early-going modulation of components (starting at 250 ms post-stimulus onset), suggesting that listeners used tonal information to constrain word recognition as soon as it became available, just like they did with phonemic information in the cohort condition. However, effects were less persistent and more left-lateralized in the segmental than cohort condition, suggesting dissociable cognitive processes underlie access to tonal versus phonemic information. Cohort versus rhyme mismatches showed distinct patterns of modulation which were very similar to what has been observed in English, suggesting onsets and rimes are weighted similarly across the two languages. Last, we did not observe effects for whole-syllable mismatches above and beyond those for mismatches in individual components, suggesting the syllable does not merit a special status in Mandarin spoken word recognition. These results are discussed with respect to modifications needed for existing models to accommodate the tonal languages spoken by a large proportion of the world's speakers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hao, YC				Hao, Yen-Chen			Contextual effect in second language perception and production of Mandarin tones	SPEECH COMMUNICATION				Article								A robust contextual effect is well documented in native tone perception and production but less well studied in non-native speech. The current study examined English-speaking learners' Mandarin tone perception and production with varying preceding and following tones. Fifteen intermediate-level learners performed an Identification and a Reading task with disyllabic stimuli encompassing various tone combinations. The results revealed that the learners' accuracy rates and error patterns varied in the initial and final position as well as in different tonal environments. For example, the learners predominantly misidentified T3 as T4 in the initial position when the following tone was T1, but rarely made such an error in the final position. In the Reading task, on the other hand, the learners frequently misproduced T3 as T2 in the final position, but often misproduced T2 as T3 in the initial position, especially when the following tone was T1. The learners' overall accuracy and error rates in Identification correlated with those in Reading, indicating comparable tone perception and production abilities. However, there were some significant differences between perception and production with regard to T3. These findings suggest that the prosodic position and surrounding tones both have a significant effect on the learners' performance with L2 tones, and that the effect differs in perception and production.												16	21											MAR	2018	97						32	42		10.1016/j.specom.2017.12.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2017.12.015												2026-01-16	WOS:000427341500004

CATEGORIZING MANDARIN TONES INTO LISTENERS' NATIVE PROSODIC CATEGORIES: THE ROLE OF PHONETIC PROPERTIES	POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS				Article								This study examined whether native speakers of non-tone languages (Australian English, and French) were able to perceive foreign Mandarin tones in a sentence environment according to their native prosodic categories. Results found that both English and French speakers were able to perceptually categorize foreign tones into their intonational categories (i-Categories), and that categorizations were based on the contextual phonetic similarities of the pitch contours they perceived between Mandarin tones and their native i-Categories. Results also showed that French speakers, but not English speakers, were able to detect the fine-detailed phonetic feature differences between Tone 3 and Tone 4 (low/falling tone vs. high-falling tone). The findings support a new extension of the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM; Best 1995) to suprasegmental phonology (So and Best 2008): that non-native prosodic categories (e. g. lexical tones) will be assimilated to the categories of listeners' native prosodic system (e. g. intonation). In addition, rhythmic differences among languages may also contribute to perception of non-native tones.												21	25											MAR	2011	47	1			SI		133	145		10.2478/psicl-2011-0011	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/psicl-2011-0011												2026-01-16	WOS:000292128200011

However, it is still not clear whether co-varying factors such as prosodic boundary, pitch range, and tone could, in turn, affect listeners' identification of creak. To fill this gap, this current study examines how creaky voice is identified in Mandarin through experimental data, aiming to enhance our understanding of cross-linguistic perception of creaky voice and, more broadly, speech perception in multi-variable contexts. Our results reveal that in Mandarin, creak identification is context-dependent: factors including prosodic position, tone, pitch range, and the amount of creak all affect how Mandarin listeners identify creak. This reflects listeners' knowledge about the distribution of creak in linguistically universal (e.g., prosodic boundary) and language-specific (e.g., lexical tone) environments.												3	3											JUL	2023	154	1					126	140		10.1121/10.0019941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0019941												2026-01-16	WOS:001027254400001

One missing element in the hypothesis is whether musical advantage is general to all or specific to some lexical tones. To further extend the hypothesis, this study investigated whether English musicians consistently outperformed English nonmusicians in perceiving a variety of Cantonese tones. In an AXB discrimination task, the musicians exhibited superior discriminatory performance over the nonmusicians only in the high level, high rising, and mid-level tone contexts. Similarly, in a Cantonese tone sequence recall task, the musicians significantly outperformed the nonmusicians only in the contour tone context but not in the level tone context. Collectively, the results reflect the selectivity of musical advantage-musical experience is only advantageous to the perception of some but not all Cantonese tones, and elements of selectivity can be introduced to the OPERA hypothesis. Methodologically, the findings highlight the need to include a wide variety of lexical tone contrasts when studying music-to-language transfer.												22	23											JUN	2020	37	5					423	434		10.1525/MP.2020.37.5.423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/MP.2020.37.5.423												2026-01-16	WOS:000573281000004
J	Pearce, M				Pearce, Mary			Kera tone and voicing interaction	LINGUA				Article								This paper sets out to investigate the relative role of Voice Onset Time (VOT) and fundamental frequency ill a language with lexical tone. By comparing English and the Chadic language Kera. this study explores the interaction between the production and perception of voicing, and the role played by voicing, in the phonological structure of the language. The major finding is that the role of VOT and F0 in the perception of voicing differs dramatically between English and Kera subjects with English subjects relying mainly oil VOT and Kera subjects mainly on F0. The phonological implications of these results for Kera are that tone is contrastive while voicing, is not, which is the reverse of English. I will propose that Kera has no [voice] feature. and that the variation in VOT plays a role as a supporting cue to tone, although the exact amount of VOT usage in Kera production and perception differs depending oil the amount of contact with French. The dominance of tone suggests that despite claims that Kera exhibits long-distance voice spreading, what spreads is in fact tone rather than voice. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Qin, Z; Jongman, A				Qin, Zhen; Jongman, Allard			Does Second Language Experience Modulate Perception of Tones in a Third Language?	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								It is unclear what roles native language (L1) and second language (L2) play in the perception of lexical tones in a third language (L3). In tone perception, listeners with different language backgrounds use different fundamental frequency (F0). While English listeners use F0 height, Mandarin listeners rely more on F0 direction. The present study addresses whether knowledge of Mandarin, particularly as an L2, results in speakers' reliance on F0 direction in their perception of L3 (Cantonese) tones. Fifteen English-speaking L2 learners of Mandarin constituted the target group, and 15 English monolinguals and 15 native Mandarin speakers, with no background in other tonal languages, were included as control groups. All groups had to discriminate Cantonese tones either by distinguishing a contour tone from a level tone (F0 direction pair) or a level tone from another level tone (F0 height pair). The results showed that L2 learners patterned differently from both control groups by using F0 direction as well as F0 height under the influence of L1 and L2 experience. The acoustics of the tones also affected all listeners' discrimination. When L2 and L3 are similar in terms of the presence of lexical tone, L2 experience modulates the perception of L3 tones.												33	41											SEP	2016	59	3					318	338		10.1177/0023830915590191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830915590191												2026-01-16	WOS:000382563900002

In this study, we compared the effectiveness of five multimodal methods for second language (L2) Mandarin tone perception training: three single-cue methods (number, pitch contour, color) and two dual-cue methods (color and number, color and pitch contour). A total of 303 true novice learners of L2 Mandarin (native speakers of English) completed a 3-week online training program. Results from pretests as well as immediate and delayed posttests indicated that multimodal training aided L2 learners' tone perception, with a small, practical advantage for pitch contours and numbers over color coding. Dual-cue methods did not yield better learning than single-cue training. Thus, the additive benefits of multimodal input (i.e., auditory and visual) did not extend to instruction featuring doubled visual input (i.e., visual and visual). We argue for embedding color in visuals in a way that helps make abstract information concrete.												24	32											DEC	2017	67	4					819	857		10.1111/lang.12246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12246												2026-01-16	WOS:000414176900003

Here, we test, for the first time in the human brain, whether neural processing of attended speech is dynamically modulated by task demand using a context-free discrimination paradigm. Electroencephalographic signals were recorded during 3 parallel experiments that differed only in the phonological feature of discrimination (word, vowel, and lexical tone, respectively). The event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed the task modulation of speech processing at approximately 200 ms (P2) after stimulus onset, probably influencing what phonological information to retain in memory. For the phonological comparison of sequential words, task modulation occurred later at approximately 300 ms (N3 and P3), reflecting the engagement of task-specific cognitive processes. The ERP results were consistent with the changes in delta-theta neural oscillations, suggesting the involvement of cortical tracking of speech envelopes. The study thus provides neurophysiological evidence for goal-oriented modulation of attended speech and calls for speech perception models incorporating limited memory capacity and goal-oriented optimization mechanisms.												2	2											MAR 21	2023	33	7					3910	3921		10.1093/cercor/bhac315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhac315		AUG 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000840811100001

A cross-boundary tone pair and a within-category tone pair derived from tonal contrasts (Mandarin Tone 1/Tone 4; Tone 2/Tone 3) with equal physical/acoustical distance were used in an auditory oddball paradigm. Fir native Mandarin speakers, the cross-category deviant elicited a larger MMN over Jell hemisphere sensors and larger P300 responses over both hemispheres relative to within-category deviants, suggesting categorical perception of tones at both pre-attentive and attentional stages of processing. In contrast, native English speakers and Mandarin learners did not demonstrate categorical effects. However, learners of Mandarin showed larger P300 responses than the other two groups, suggesting heightened sensitivity to tones and possibly greater attentional resource allocation to tone identification.												39	46											MAR	2019	22	2					253	265		10.1017/S136672891800038X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S136672891800038X												2026-01-16	WOS:000461558600003

Acquisition of such a tone system may be challenging to prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants because, as recent studies have shown, cochlear implant devices are ineffective in encoding voice pitch information required for tone recognition. This study aimed to investigate Mandarin tone production and perception skills of children with cochlear implants. Design: Thirty prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants, ages 6;0 (yr;mo) to 12;6, participated. These children received their implants at an average age of 5;8, with a range from 2;3 to 10;3. The average length of their cochlear implant experience was 3;7, with a range from 1;7 to 6;5. Tasks of tone production and tone identification involved a pictorial protocol of 48 words containing the targeted tones in either monosyllabic or disyllabic forms. Results: The average scores for tone production was 53.09% (SD = 15.42), and for tone identification was 72.88% (SD = 19.68; chance level = 50%). Significant differences were found in the percentages across the production or identification of tone types or tone pairs. The children with exceptional performance in tone production tended to also perform well in tone identification. The children's performance levels in tone identification and production were also discussed in relation to the factors of age at implantation and length of cochlear implant experience. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the majority of prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants did not master Mandarin tone production. However, a small group of participants demonstrated nearly perfect skills of Mandarin tone production in addition to tone perception. Thus, it is necessary to consider factors other than the device's limitations to explain these high levels of performance in the perception and production of Mandarin lexical tones.												140	166											JUN	2004	25	3					251	264		10.1097/01.AUD.0000130797.73809.40	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.AUD.0000130797.73809.40												2026-01-16	WOS:000221828400006

Harald; Chen, Yiya			The temporal dynamics of perceptual uncertainty: eye movement evidence from Cantonese segment and tone perception	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE				Article								Two visual world eyetracking experiments investigated how acoustic cue value and statistical variance affect perceptual uncertainty during Cantonese consonant (Experiment 1) and tone perception (Experiment 2). Participants heard low- or high-variance acoustic stimuli. Euclidean distance of fixations from target and competitor pictures over time was analysed using Generalised Additive Mixed Modelling. Distance of fixations from target and competitor pictures varied as a function of acoustic cue, providing evidence for gradient, nonlinear sensitivity to cue values. Moreover, cue value effects significantly interacted with statistical variance, indicating that the cue distribution directly affects perceptual uncertainty. Interestingly, the time course of effects differed between target distance and competitor distance models. The pattern of effects over time suggests a global strategy in response to the level of uncertainty: as uncertainty increases, verification looks increase accordingly. Low variance generally creates less uncertainty, but can lead to greater uncertainty in the face of unexpected speech tokens. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Liu, C				Liu, Chang			Just noticeable difference of tone pitch contour change for English- and Chinese-native listeners	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Just noticeable differences of tone pitch contour discrimination were examined for young English- and Mandarin Chinese-native listeners to examine categorical features of tone perception for the two groups of listeners. Three types of stimuli were used: A Mandarin Chinese vowel, an English vowel, and tonal glides. Level, rising, and falling tones within or across tone boundaries served as the standard stimuli to measure thresholds of tone pitch discrimination. Performance was equivalent between English-and Chinese-native listeners for level tones, but significantly differed for rising and falling tones, regardless of the type of stimuli. English listeners showed significantly lower thresholds at the offset of F0 shifts than Chinese listeners, while Chinese listeners discriminated tone pitch changes at the onset with significantly lower thresholds than their English peers. These psychophysical results, combined with tone perception reported in other studies, indicated that Mandarin-native listeners perceived lexical tones in a categorical manner, based on their lexical tone experience, whereas English-native listeners perceived tones on a psychophysical base.

This study aims to tease apart the above effects by investigating the weighting of pitch, duration and intensity cues in stress-timed (Australian English) and non-stress-timed and tonal (Taiwan Mandarin) language speaking adults using a mismatch negativity (MMN) multi-feature paradigm. Results show effects that can be explained by language-specific rhythmic influence, but only partially by the ITL. Moreover, these findings revealed cross-linguistic differences indexed by both MMN and late discriminative negativity (LDN) responses at cue and syllable position levels, and thus call for more sophisticated perspectives for existing cue-weighting models.												5	6											SEP	2022	232								105151	10.1016/j.bandl.2022.105151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2022.105151												2026-01-16	WOS:000826841400001

However, effect sizes and significance differ across studies. In a meta-analysis, we assessed the overall size of this relation across 109 studies and investigated which factors moderated the effect. We found a significant, medium-sized positive correlation between musical abilities and speech prosody perception. This correlation was larger for studies on non-native compared to native prosody perception. We attribute this difference to ceiling performance in native perception, while non-native perception may be more difficult and can thus be facilitated by musical abilities. In addition, prosody perception was more strongly correlated with music perception than with music training, possibly because training metrics disregard untrained individuals with naturally strong musical abilities. Further analyses showed a stronger correlation for prosodic pitch compared to prosodic timing perception, and a stronger correlation for behavioural accuracy measures compared to reaction times. We did not find differences in effects between linguistic and emotional prosody, between L1 tone language users or non-tone language users, or between adults and children. This meta-analysis generally supports theories proposing a connection between music and speech prosody. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential importance of individuals' musical abilities for the acquisition of second language prosody.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lee, CY				Lee, Chao-Yang			Identifying isolated, multispeaker Mandarin tones from brief acoustic input: A perceptual and acoustic study	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Lexical tone identification relies primarily on the processing of F0. Since F0 range differs across individuals, the interpretation of F0 usually requires reference to specific speakers. This study examined whether multispeaker Mandarin tone stimuli could be identified without cues commonly considered necessary for speaker normalization. The sa syllables, produced by 16 speakers of each gender, were digitally processed such that only the fricative and the first six glottal periods remained in the stimuli, neutralizing the dynamic F0 contrasts among the tones. Each stimulus was presented once, in isolation, to 40 native listeners who had no prior exposure to the speakers' voices. Chi-square analyses showed that tone identification accuracy exceeded chance as did tone classification based on F0 height. Acoustic analyses showed contrasts between the high- and low-onset tones in F0, duration, and two voice quality measures (F1 bandwidth and spectral tilt). Correlation analyses showed that F0 covaried with the voice quality measures and that tone classification based on F0 height also correlated with these acoustic measures. Since the same acoustic measures consistently distinguished the female from the male stimuli, gender detection may be implicated in F0 height estimation when no context, dynamic F0, or familiarity with speaker voices is available.

Despite the wide application across subfields, phonological distance has been calculated mainly with features related to consonants and vowels. This research report establishes new measurements of phonological distance that incorporate lexical tone through experimental approaches and modeling, using Hong Kong Cantonese as a case study. Results show correspondences between the experimental data and predictions from information-theoretic measures, including entropy measures and functional load, suggesting that lexical components which play a more crucial role in phonological distance judgments are lexically less predictable as well.

Each word has a distinctive tone, signaled by fundamental frequency variations at the syllable level. We investigated the relative efficiency of alaryngeal Cantonese speakers in conveying tonal variations in words in citation form. isolated tone tokens were produced by three esophageal speakers, two tracheoesophageal speakers, two pneumatic artificial laryngeal speakers, and two electrolaryngeal speakers for perceptual tests. The correct responses from 22 listeners were highest for the pneumatic artificial laryngeal speakers, and could be graded in order of proficiency as esophageal, tracheoesophageal, and electrolaryngeal speakers. These results provide a linguistic perspective tor guiding voice rehabilitation and the choice of voice in alaryngeal patients who speak a tone language.												27	29											JUN	1994	37	3					557	571		10.1044/jshr.3703.557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/jshr.3703.557												2026-01-16	WOS:A1994NP96500007

Although CIs could enable users to communicate in clear listening environments, noisy environments still pose a problem. To improve speech-processing strategies used in Chinese CIs, we explored the relative contributions made by the temporal envelope in various frequency regions, as relevant to Mandarin sentence recognition in noise. Methods Original speech material from the Mandarin version of the Hearing in Noise Test (MHINT) was mixed with speech-shaped noise (SSN), sinusoidally amplitude-modulated speech-shaped noise (SAM SSN), and sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) white noise (4 Hz) at a + 5 dB signal-to-noise ratio, respectively. Envelope information of the noise-corrupted speech material was extracted from 30 contiguous bands that were allocated to five frequency regions. The intelligibility of the noise-corrupted speech material (temporal cues from one or two regions were removed) was measured to estimate the relative weights of temporal envelope cues from the five frequency regions. Results In SSN, the mean weights of Regions 1-5 were 0.34, 0.19, 0.20, 0.16, and 0.11, respectively; in SAM SSN, the mean weights of Regions 1-5 were 0.34, 0.17, 0.24, 0.14, and 0.11, respectively; and in SAM white noise, the mean weights of Regions 1-5 were 0.46, 0.24, 0.22, 0.06, and 0.02, respectively. Conclusions The results suggest that the temporal envelope in the low-frequency region transmits the greatest amount of information in terms of Mandarin sentence recognition for three types of noise, which differed from the perception strategy employed in clear listening environments.												0	0											JUN 13	2022	23	1							35	10.1186/s12868-022-00721-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12868-022-00721-z												2026-01-16	WOS:000810667300002
J	Wiener, S; Ito, K; Speer, SR				Wiener, Seth; Ito, Kiwako; Speer, Shari R.			Early L2 Spoken Word Recognition Combines Input-Based and Knowledge-Based Processing	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study examines the perceptual trade-off between knowledge of a language's statistical regularities and reliance on the acoustic signal during L2 spoken word recognition. We test how early learners track and make use of segmental and suprasegmental cues and their relative frequencies during non-native word recognition. English learners of Mandarin were taught an artificial tonal language in which a tone's informativeness for word identification varied according to neighborhood density. The stimuli mimicked Mandarin's uneven distribution of syllable+tone combinations by varying syllable frequency and the probability of particular tones co-occurring with a particular syllable. Use of statistical regularities was measured by four-alternative forced-choice judgments and by eye fixations to target and competitor symbols. Half of the participants were trained on one speaker, that is, low speaker variability while the other half were trained on four speakers. After four days of learning, the results confirmed that tones are processed according to their informativeness. Eye movements to the newly learned symbols demonstrated that L2 learners use tonal probabilities at an early stage of word recognition, regardless of speaker variability. The amount of variability in the signal, however, influenced the time course of recovery from incorrect anticipatory looks: participants exposed to low speaker variability recovered from incorrect probability-based predictions of tone more rapidly than participants exposed to greater variability. These results motivate two conclusions: early L2 learners track the distribution of segmental and suprasegmental co-occurrences and make predictions accordingly during spoken word recognition; and when the acoustic input is more variable because of multi-speaker input, listeners rely more on their knowledge of tone-syllable co-occurrence frequency distributions and less on the incoming acoustic signal.												24	29											DEC	2018	61	4			SI		632	656		10.1177/0023830918761762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830918761762												2026-01-16	WOS:000450354100008
J	Kadyamusuma, MR; De Bleser, R; Mayer, J				Kadyamusuma, McLoddy R.; De Bleser, Ria; Mayer, Joerg			Perceptual discrimination of Shona lexical tones and low-pass filtered speech by left and right hemisphere damaged patients	APHASIOLOGY				Article								Background: While the role of the right hemisphere (RH) in prosodic processing is prominent, research on the perception of lexical tones has shown that left hemisphere damaged (LHD) patients are more impaired than right hemisphere damaged (RHD) patients. Dichotic listening and imaging studies with healthy speakers of tone languages demonstrate that at least at the phonemic and lexical level, prosody is processed in the left hemisphere (LH) when the variations in pitch are phonemically distinctive. There is no report available yet on the perceptual discrimination of a Bantu language in patients after unilateral brain damage. Aims: We addressed the question of how well Shona aphasic patients and right hemisphere damaged patients perceive pitch contrasts in Shona lexical words and also in their homologous low-pass filtered counterparts. We also sought to discover the validity of the current hypotheses on hemispheric lateralisation particularly the hypothesis on hemispheric lateralisation based on language function to account for the Shona data. Methods Procedures: A total of 7 LHD and 7 RHD patients and 14 healthy controls participated in two discrimination tasks that examined perception of lexical tone in (a) bisyllabic Shona words and (b) low-pass filtered stimuli. In both tasks the participants were tasked with judging the pitch as the same or different in 120 bisyllabic words and 120 low-pass filtered stimuli. Outcomes Results: The results demonstrated that the tonal discrimination of the LHD group was more reduced in comparison to the RHD group and control participants. However, the performance of the RHD patients was not error free relative to the control participants, although significantly better than the LHD patients in both tasks. Conclusions: At least for the phonemic and lexical levels, brain damage to the dominant hemisphere results in lexical tone impairment for LHD patients, and cognitive load processing results in a subdued but good performance for RHD patients. The LH is therefore dominant for processing tone when it is lexically distinctive.												7	7												2011	25	5					576	592	PII 934907647	10.1080/02687038.2010.540336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02687038.2010.540336												2026-01-16	WOS:000289801300003

Identification of acoustically modified Mandarin tones by native listeners	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study investigated Mandarin tone identification by 40 native listeners when only partial acoustic information was available. Twelve minimal tone pairs including all six Mandarin tonal contrasts were digitally processed to generate four syllable modifications: intact, silent-center, center-only, and onset-only. The syllables were recorded in two carrier phrases such that the offset of the carrier tone and the onset of the test tone were either a match or mismatch in fundamental frequency (f(0)). In three experiments, the test syllables were presented in the original carrier phrases, excised from the carrier phrases, or excised and cross-spliced with another carrier phrase. Response accuracy and reaction time (RT) were measured. Listeners identified the tones at better than 86% correct with or without the carriers except when they heard the onset-only syllables in isolation, when their identification accuracy fell to 73% but still beyond chance. The modifications impacted the four tones differently, with Tones 1 and 2 being compromised more than Tones 3 and 4. Confusion matrix analyses showed that Tone 2 was predominantly confused with Tone 3. and Tone 1 was primarily confused with Tone 4. There were no main effects of splicing or match/mismatch with the carrier tone; however, in the cross-spliced context, syllables originally produced with a matching carrier tone were identified faster and/or more accurately. The implications of these findings for lexical tone processing are discussed.

J	Crowe, K; McLeod, S				Crowe, Kathryn; McLeod, Sharynne			A systematic review of cross-linguistic and multilingual speech and language outcomes for children with hearing loss	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND BILINGUALISM				Article								The purpose of this study was to systematically review the factors affecting the language, speech intelligibility, speech production, and lexical tone development of children with hearing loss who use spoken languages other than English. Relevant studies of children with hearing loss published between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed with reference to (1) methodologies used, (2) children's outcomes, (3) factors affecting children's outcomes, and (4) publication quality. The review included 117 studies describing 20 languages. Monolingual children were described in 109, and multilingual children were described in 8. Better performance outcomes were frequently associated with earlier age of hearing loss diagnosis, intervention, amplification, and less severe hearing loss - a finding similar to studies of English-speaking children. Studies frequently did not report or include information about participant characteristics, blinding of researchers, and reliability. Cross-linguistic comparison of children's outcomes across studies was not possible due to differences in the outcomes assessed, assessment and analysis methods, and participant characteristics. There is a need for cross-linguistic comparisons of the speech and language outcomes of children with hearing loss, but there is little scope for this using existing published research. Few studies described the outcomes of multilingual children with hearing loss.												19	22											MAY 4	2014	17	3					287	309		10.1080/13670050.2012.758686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13670050.2012.758686												2026-01-16	WOS:000330757400009

There are relatively few studies regarding Mandarin-speaking pediatric Cl users' perception of more difficult speech materials (e.g., words and sentences produced by multiple talkers). Difficult speech materials and tests necessarily require older pediatric Cl users, who may have different etiologies of hearing loss, duration of deafness, Cl experience. The present study investigated how pediatric Cl patient demographics influence speech recognition performance with relatively difficult test materials and methods. Methods: In this study, open-set recognition of multi-talker (two males and two females) Mandarin Chinese disyllables and sentences were measured in 37 Mandarin-speaking pediatric Cl users. Subjects were grouped according to etiology of deafness and previous acoustic hearing experience. Group 1 subjects were all congenitally deafened with little-to-no acoustic hearing experience. Group 2 subjects were not congenitally deafened and had substantial acoustic hearing experience prior to implantation. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed within each group using subject demographics such as age at implantation and age at testing. Results: Pediatric Cl performance was generally quite good. For Group 1, mean performance was 82.3% correct for disyllables and 82.8% correct for sentences. For Group 2, mean performance was 76.6% correct for disyllables and 84.4% correct for sentences. For Group 1, multiple linear regression analyses showed that age at implantation predicted disyllable recognition, and that age at implantation and age at testing predicted sentence recognition. For Group 2, neither age at implantation nor age at testing predicted disyllable or sentence recognition. Performance was significantly better with the female than with the male talkers. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies' findings, early implantation provided a significant advantage for profoundly deaf children. Performance for both groups was generally quite good for the relatively difficult materials and tasks, suggesting that open-set word and sentence recognition may be useful in evaluating speech performance with older pediatric Cl users. Differences in disyllable recognition between Groups 1 and 2 may reflect differences in adaptation to electric stimulation. The Group 1 subjects developed speech patterns exclusively via electric stimulation, while the Group 2 subjects adapted to electric stimulation relative to previous acoustic patterns.

J	Liu, LQ; Kager, R				Liu, Liquan; Kager, Rene			Enhanced music sensitivity in 9-month-old bilingual infants	COGNITIVE PROCESSING				Article								This study explores the influence of bilingualism on the cognitive processing of language and music. Specifically, we investigate how infants learning a non-tone language perceive linguistic and musical pitch and how bilingualism affects cross-domain pitch perception. Dutch monolingual and bilingual infants of 8-9 months participated in the study. All infants had Dutch as one of the first languages. The other first languages, varying among bilingual families, were not tone or pitch accent languages. In two experiments, infants were tested on the discrimination of a lexical (N = 42) or a violin (N = 48) pitch contrast via a visual habituation paradigm. The two contrasts shared identical pitch contours but differed in timbre. Non-tone language learning infants did not discriminate the lexical contrast regardless of their ambient language environment. When perceiving the violin contrast, bilingual but not monolingual infants demonstrated robust discrimination. We attribute bilingual infants' heightened sensitivity in the musical domain to the enhanced acoustic sensitivity stemming from a bilingual environment. The distinct perceptual patterns between language and music and the influence of acoustic salience on perception suggest processing diversion and association in the first year of life. Results indicate that the perception of music may entail both shared neural network with language processing, and unique neural network that is distinct from other cognitive functions.												14	15											FEB	2017	18	1					55	65		10.1007/s10339-016-0780-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10339-016-0780-7												2026-01-16	WOS:000397199200006

Method: Two types of noise served as the masker, namely, six-talker babble and babble-modulated noise, at two signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -4 and -8 dB. Fourteen listeners from both age groups were recruited, and three sets of data analyses were conducted: the identification of vowel plus tone, the identification of vowel, and the identification of tone. Results: Younger listeners outperformed older listeners in all listening conditions, whereas the younger-older listener difference became greater in noise than in quiet, indicating a more detrimental effect of noise for older listeners than for younger listeners. In addition, vowel identification showed slightly better scores than tone identification in noise, suggesting that noise appeared to affect tone perception more negatively than vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese. At -4 dB SNR, there was a significantly greater amount of informational masking (IM) and a greater amount of energetic masking (EM) for older listeners than for younger listeners. At -8 dB SNR, there was a greater amount of EM for older listeners than for younger listeners but with no group difference in the amount of IM. Conclusion: These results suggest that older listeners received a more negative impact of noise for Mandarin Chinese phonemic and tone recognition and had a larger amount of IM or EM from competing speech noise than younger listeners, depending on the SNR.												9	10											SEP	2021	30	3					616	630		10.1044/2021_AJA-20-00139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_AJA-20-00139												2026-01-16	WOS:000695223000012
J	Winskel, H				Winskel, Heather			Orthographic and phonological parafoveal processing of consonants, vowels, and tones when reading Thai	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS				Article								Four eye movement experiments investigated whether readers use parafoveal input to gain information about the phonological or orthographic forms of consonants, vowels, and tones in word recognition when reading Thai silently. Target words were presented in sentences preceded by parafoveal previews in which consonant, vowel, or tone information was manipulated. Previews of homophonous consonants (Experiment I) and concordant vowels (Experiment 2) did not substantially facilitate processing of the target word, whereas the identical previews did. Hence, orthography appears to be playing the prominent role in early word recognition for consonants and vowels. Incorrect tone marker previews (Experiment 3) substantially retarded the subsequent processing of the target word, indicating that lexical tone plays an important role in early word recognition. Vowels in VOP (Experiment 4) did not facilitate processing, which points to vowel position being a significant factor. Primarily, orthographic codes of consonants and vowels (HOP) in conjunction with tone information are assembled from parafoveal input and used for early lexical access.												11	16											OCT	2011	32	4					739	759		10.1017/S014271641100004X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S014271641100004X												2026-01-16	WOS:000295420900004
J	Kwok, VPY; Dan, G; Yakpo, K; Matthews, S; Tan, LH				Kwok, Veronica P. Y.; Dan, Guo; Yakpo, Kofi; Matthews, Stephen; Tan, Li Hai			Neural systems for auditory perception of lexical tones	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS				Article								Previous neuroimaging research on cognitive processing of speech tone has generated dramatically different patterns of findings. Even at the basic perception level, brain mapping studies of lexical tones have yielded inconsistent results. Apart from the data inconsistency problem, experimental materials in past studies of tone perception carried little or minimal lexical semantics, an important dimension that should not be dispensed with because speech tones serve to distinguish lexical meanings. The present study sought to examine the neural correlates of the perception of speech tone using lexically meaningful experimental stimuli. A simple lexical tone perception task was devised in which native Mandarin speakers were asked to judge whether or not the two syllables of an auditorily presented Chinese bisyllabic word had the same tone. We selected bisyllabic words as experimental stimuli because Chinese monosyllables often convey little or very vague meanings due to rampant homophony. We found that the left inferior frontal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus and bilateral superior temporal gyri are responsible for basic perception of linguistic pitches. Our interpretation of the data sees the left superior temporal gyrus as engaged in primary acoustic analysis of the auditory stimuli, while the right middle superior temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal region are involved in both tonal and semantic processing of the language stimuli.

Mandarin-speaking preschoolers' pitch discrimination, prosodic and phonological awareness, and their relation to receptive vocabulary and reading abilities	READING AND WRITING				Article								Cross-linguistic studies have reported that prosodic pattern awareness (e.g., lexical stress and lexical tone) is more important to reading acquisition than phonological awareness. However, few longitudinal studies have been conducted to explore the relations between these variables. This study examined preschoolers' pitch discrimination, prosodic and phonological awareness, and their connection to receptive vocabulary in preschool and reading abilities in first grade. Findings reveal (1) children improve their pitch discrimination and prosodic awareness from preschool to fourth grade; (2) pitch interval discrimination (frequency separation between tones) contributes to receptive vocabulary whereas pitch contour discrimination (patterns of rising and falling pitch) predicts word reading; (3) phonological awareness accounts for more variability in receptive vocabulary than prosodic awareness; whereas the reverse was found for word reading and reading comprehension. Together, prosody and its acoustic cue (i.e., pitch) play a vital role in learning to read Mandarin.												19	23											FEB	2021	34	2					337	353		10.1007/s11145-020-10075-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11145-020-10075-9		JUL 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000550587100001
J	Zhu, WL; Qu, LL; Meng, WJ; Guan, CQ				Zhu, Wenlin; Qu, Lulu; Meng, Wanjin; Guan, Connie Qun			Effects of Music Perception on Language Development in Children With Cochlear Implants: A Systematic Review	AMERICAN ANNALS OF THE DEAF				Article								Children with cochlear implants (CIs) have difficulties developing overall language skills due to a lack of neurological adjustment for multimodality inputs. Fortunately, music perception might play a role in strengthening the connection between auditory and motor perception, as language and music have shared neural mechanisms in the left hemisphere of the brain.This review synthesized the recently peer-reviewed studies on the role of music perception in language development for children with CIs by containing the search on pertinent keywords in eight databases following systematic inclusion rubrics. A total of 17 most relevant studies published between 2014 and 2025 were identified. We analyzed the studies focusing on the special role of music perception linked to improved speech perception in children with CIs and the types of musical training that have been found to be effective in improving speech perception and/or spoken language in children with CIs. We analyzed them by the demographics of the participants, music training methods, and language assessment tools, etc. for language development in children with CIs. We concluded the following two major findings: (1) A strong correlation exists between music perception and language development, especially in children with CIs, and (2) music training can potentially bridge the gap in language performance between children with CIs and those with normal hearing by facilitating crossmodal neuroplasticity. The findings of this synthesis suggest that children with CIs may benefit from music perception in early childhood to strengthen their neuroplasticity through visual-motor connectivity through music.The findings of our systematic review highlight the unique role of music perception in bridging language gaps for children with CIs.												1	1											SPR	2025	170	1					14	38		10.1353/aad.2025.a966640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/aad.2025.a966640												2026-01-16	WOS:001546021700002
J	Bao, WF; Arnhold, A; Järvikivi, J				Bao, Wenfu; Arnhold, Anja; Jarvikivi, Juhani			Phonology, homophony, and eyes-closed rest in Mandarin novel word learning: An eye-tracking study in adult native and non-native speakers	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS				Article								This study used the visual world paradigm to investigate novel word learning in adults from different language backgrounds and the effects of phonology, homophony, and rest on the outcome. We created Mandarin novel words varied by types of phonological contrasts and homophone status. During the experiment, native (n = 34) and non-native speakers (English; n = 30) learned pairs of novel words and were tested twice with a 15-minute break in between, which was spent either resting or gaming. In the post-break test of novel word recognition, an interaction appeared between language backgrounds, phonology, and homophony: non-native speakers performed less accurately than native speakers only on non-homophones learned in pairs with tone contrasts. Eye movement data indicated that non-native speakers' processing of tones may be more effortful than their processing of segments while learning homophones, as demonstrated by the time course. Interestingly, no significant effects of rest were observed across language groups; yet after gaming, native speakers achieved higher accuracy than non-native speakers. Overall, this study suggests that Mandarin novel word learning can be affected by participants' language backgrounds and phonological and homophonous features of words. However, the role of short periods of rest in novel word learning requires further investigation.												1	1											JAN	2024	45	1					213	242		10.1017/S0142716424000031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0142716424000031		MAR 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001177866400001

In the current study, bilingual and monolingual toddlers were compared on their ability to recognize familiar words. Children were presented with correct pronunciations and mispronunciations, with the latter involving a vowel, consonant, or tone substitution. A robust ability to recognize words when their labels were correctly pronounced was observed in both groups. Both groups also exhibited a robust ability to reject vowel, tone, and consonant mispronunciations as possible labels for familiar words. However, time course analyses revealed processing differences based on language background; relative to Mandarin mono-linguals, Mandarin-English bilingual toddlers demonstrated reduced efficiency in recognizing correctly pronounced words. With respect to mispronunciations, Mandarin-English bilingual learners demonstrated reduced sensitivity to tone mispronunciations relative to Mandarin monolingual toddlers. Moreover, the relative cost of mispronunciations differed for monolingual and bilingual toddlers. Monolingual toddlers demonstrated least sensitivity to consonants followed by vowels and tones, whereas bilingual toddlers demonstrated least sensitivity to tone, followed by consonants and then by vowels. Time course analyses revealed that both groups were sensitive to vowel and consonant variation. Results reveal both similarities and differences in monolingual and bilingual learners' processing of familiar words in Mandarin Chinese. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J	Schaefer, V; Darcy, I				Schaefer, Vance; Darcy, Isabelle			Lexical function of pitch in the first language shapes cross-linguistic perception of Thai tones	LABORATORY PHONOLOGY				Article								Determining the factors involved in the non-native perception of the pitch patterns of tones is complicated by the fact that all languages use pitch to various extents, whether linguistic (e.g., intonation) or non-linguistic (e.g., singing). Moreover, many languages use pitch to distinguish lexical items with varying degrees of functional load and differences in inventory of such pitch patterns. The current study attempts to understand what factors determine accurate naive (= non-learner) perception of non-native tones, in order to establish the baseline for acquisition of a tonal L2. We examine the perception of Thai tones (i.e., three level tones, two contour tones) by speakers of languages on a spectrum of lexically contrastive pitch usage: Mandarin (lexical tone), Japanese (lexical pitch accent), English (lexical stress), and Korean (no lexically contrastive pitch). Results suggest that the importance of lexically contrastive pitch in the L1 influences non-native tone perception so that not all non-tonal language speakers possess the same level of tonal sensitivity, resulting in a hierarchy of perceptual accuracy. Referencing the Feature Hypothesis (McAllister et al. 2002), we propose the Functional Pitch Hypothesis to model our findings: the degree to which linguistic pitch differentiates lexical items in the L1 shapes the naive perception of a non-native lexically contrastive pitch system, e.g., tones.												29	40											NOV	2014	5	4					489	522		10.1515/lp-2014-0016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/lp-2014-0016												2026-01-16	WOS:000365703800003

This work measured the auditory mismatch responses to Mandarin lexical tones, initial consonants, and vowels in 4- to 6-year-old preschoolers using the multiple-deviant oddball paradigm. The data showed the coexistence of MMN and P-MMR in the same age group when responding to the three types of syllabic features in Mandarin. The transition from a predominantly positive response to a predominantly negative response supported the multiple MMN mechanisms. Congruent with the phonological saliency hypothesis and the phonetic acquisition order of Mandarin in behavioral studies, for the compulsory elements of Mandarin syllables, lexical tones, and vowels, the larger deviants elicited adult-like MMNs, whereas the smaller deviants elicited P-MMRs. The optional elements of the Mandarin syllables, the initial consonant, only elicited P-MMR in preschoolers. These findings suggest that MMN and P-MMR index different functional characteristics and may provide information on when and how children's speech perception becomes automatic at different developmental stages.

Contribution of bimodal hearing to lexical tone normalization in Mandarin-speaking cochlear implant users	HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Native Mandarin normal-hearing (NH) listeners can easily perceive lexical tones even under conditions of great voice pitch variations across speakers by using the pitch contrast between context and target stimuli. It is however unclear whether cochlear implant (Cl) users with limited access to pitch cues can make similar use of context pitch cues for tone normalization. In this study, native Mandarin NH listeners and pre-lingually deafened unilaterally implanted CI users were asked to recognize a series of Mandarin tones varying from Tone 1 (high-flat) to Tone 2 (mid-rising) with or without a preceding sentence context. Most of the Cl subjects used a hearing aid (HA) in the non-implanted ear (i.e., bimodal users) and were tested both with CI alone and CI + HA. In the test without context, typical S-shaped tone recognition functions were observed for most CI subjects and the function slopes and perceptual boundaries were similar with either CI alone or CI + HA. Compared to NH subjects, CI subjects were less sensitive to the pitch changes in target tones. In the test with context, NH subjects had more (resp. fewer) Tone-2 responses in a context with high (resp. low) fundamental frequencies, known as the contrastive context effect. For Cl subjects, a similar contrastive context effect was found statistically significant for tone recognition with CI + HA but not with CI alone. The results suggest that the pitch cues from CIs may not be sufficient to consistently support the pitch contrast processing for tone normalization. The additional pitch cues from aided residual acoustic hearing can however provide Cl users with a similar tone normalization capability as NH listeners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sereno, JA; Lee, H				Sereno, Joan A.; Lee, Hyunjung			The Contribution of Segmental and Tonal Information in Mandarin Spoken Word Processing	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Two priming experiments examined the separate contribution of lexical tone and segmental information in the processing of spoken words in Mandarin Chinese. Experiment 1 contrasted four types of prime-target pairs: tone-and-segment overlap (ru4-ru4), segment-only overlap (ru3-ru4), tone-only overlap (sha4-ru4) and unrelated (qin1-ru4) in an auditory lexical decision task with 48 native Mandarin listeners. Experiment 2 further investigated the minimal segmental overlap needed to trigger priming when tonal information is present. Four prime-target conditions were contrasted: tone-and-segment overlap (ru4-ru4), only onset segment overlap (re4-ru4), only rime overlap (pu4-ru4) and unrelated (qin1-ru4) in an auditory lexical decision task with 68 native Mandarin listeners. The results showed significant priming effects when both tonal and segmental information overlapped or, although to a lesser extent, when only segmental information overlapped, with no priming found when only tones matched. Moreover, any partial segmental overlap, even with matching tonal cues, resulted in significant inhibition. These data clearly indicate that lexical tones are processed differently from segments, with syllabic structure playing a critical role. These findings are discussed in terms of the overall architecture of the processing system that emerges in Mandarin lexical access.												49	49											JUN	2015	58	2					131	151		10.1177/0023830914522956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830914522956												2026-01-16	WOS:000354864700001
J	Ye, Y; Connine, CM				Ye, Y; Connine, CM			Processing spoken Chinese: The role of tone information	LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES				Article								Vowel and tone monitoring tasks were used to investigate the role of tone information in processing Mandarin. In Experiment 1, participants monitored for a tone-plus-vowel combination (tone 2-/a/). Both existent (known) and non-existent syllables contained targets and monitoring reaction times showed faster monitoring times for existent syllable carriers. Non-target bearing existent syllables mismatched on either the vowel or the tone and showed faster responses for vowel mismatch stimuli. This finding supports a perceptual advantage for vowel information. In Experiment 2, separate vowel and tone monitoring tasks were used for target syllables that occurred phrase-finally in idiomatic (highly constraining) phrases or neutral semantic context. In the neutral context, vowel monitoring was faster than tone monitoring. In contrast, highly predictive contexts showed a tone advantage. Experiment 3 used idiomatic contexts that did or did not contain a mismatching tone in the penultimate syllable. Mismatching tones were very similar to or highly distinct from the intended tone and both tone and vowel monitoring reaction times showed graded effects based on similarity of the mismatch. A modified version of the TRACE model for tone languages that includes a separate level or representation for tones that permit graded activation and highly interconnected syllable representations is discussed.												113	133											OCT-DEC	1999	14	5-6					609	630		10.1080/016909699386202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016909699386202												2026-01-16	WOS:000084235200008

Speaker variability and context in the identification of fragmented Mandarin tones by native and non-native listeners	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study investigated the individual and joint contribution of speaker variability, context, and type of acoustic input to the identification of Mandarin tones. Mandarin syllables produced by single vs. multiple speakers were digitally processed to generate intact. silent-center, center-only, and onset-only syllables to be presented in isolation or with a precursor carrier phrase. Forty native listeners and 55 non-native listeners were put under time pressure to identify the tones of the syllables. The results showed higher identification accuracy for single-speaker tones and tones presented in context. Tone identification accuracy also decreased as acoustic input was reduced. The speaker variability effect showed comparable magnitude for the native and non-native listeners. In contrast, non-native tone identification, compared to the native performance, was facilitated less by context and compromised more when acoustic input was minimal. Tone confusion analyses showed a Tone 2-Tone 3 confusion and a bias towards Tone 4 responses for both groups of listeners, but the patterns of confusion and bias are more variable in the non-native responses. The non-native listeners also showed inconsistent evidence of using F0 height for tone identification when acoustic input was minimal.

It has been shown that native speakers of French, a language without lexical stress, have difficulties storing non-native stress contrasts. We investigated whether the ability to store lexical tone (as in Mandarin Chinese) also depends on the first language (L I) prosodic structure and, if so, how. We tested participants from a stress language (German), a language without word stress (French), a language with restricted lexical tonal contrasts (Japanese), and Mandarin Chinese controls. Furthermore, German has a rich intonational structure, while French and Japanese dispose of fewer utterance-level pitch contrasts. The participants learnt associations between disyllabic non-words (4 tonal contrasts) and objects and indicated whether picture word pairs matched with what they had learnt (complete match, segmental or tonal mismatch conditions). In the tonal mismatch condition, the Mandarin Chinese controls had the highest sensitivity, followed by the German participants. The French and Japanese participants showed no sensitivity towards these tonal contrasts. Utterance-level prosody is hence better able to predict success in second language (L2) tone learning than word prosody.												27	37											JUL	2014	30	3					323	350		10.1177/0267658313510926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0267658313510926												2026-01-16	WOS:000337654200003

Tone recognition in continuous Cantonese speech using supratone models	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This paper studies automatic tone recognition in continuous Cantonese speech. Cantonese is a major Chinese dialect that is known for being rich in tones. Tone information serves as a useful knowledge source for automatic speech recognition of Cantonese. Cantonese tone recognition is difficult because the tones have similar shapes of pitch contours. The tones are differentiated mainly by their relative pitch heights. In natural speech, the pitch level of a tone may shift up and down and the F0 ranges of different tones overlap with each other, making them acoustically indistinguishable within the domain of a syllable. Our study shows that the relative pitch heights are largely preserved between neighboring tones. A novel method of supratone modeling is proposed for Cantonese tone recognition. Each supratone model characterizes the F0 contour of two or three tones in succession. The tone sequence of a continuous utterance is formed as an overlapped concatenation of supratone units. The most likely tone sequence is determined under phonological constraints on syllable-tone combinations. The proposed method attains an accuracy of 74.68% in speaker-independent tone recognition experiments. In particular, the confusion among the tones with similar contour shapes is greatly resolved.

The effect of context duration on Mandarin listeners' tone normalization	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Tone normalization has been observed in Mandarin listeners, who contrastively adjust tone recognition using context pitch cues. This study tested the effect of context duration on Mandarin tone normalization. The target tones varied from Tone 1 (high-flat) to Tone 2 (mid-rising). The preceding phrase was modified to have different durations with 160- or 200-Hz mean fundamental frequencies (F0s). The results showed that the high-F0 context elicited significantly more Tone-2 responses than the low-F0 context, even when the contexts were 125 ms. The contrastive context effect saturated with the 250-ms contexts, indicating a 250-ms critical context duration for robust tone normalization.

J	Lee, CY; Lekich, A; Zhang, Y				Lee, Chao-Yang; Lekich, Allison; Zhang, Yu			Perception of pitch height in lexical and musical tones by English-speaking musicians and nonmusicians	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								The purpose of this study was to explore the music-speech relationship by examining pitch height perception in lexical and musical tones. English-speaking musicians and nonmusicians identified multispeaker Taiwanese level tones without typical cues for speaker normalization. The musicians also identified note names of piano, viola, and pure tones without a reference pitch. In the Taiwanese task, both the musicians and nonmusicians were able to identify tone height above chance, but only for tones at the extremes of the speakers' overall vocal range. The musicians only had a slight advantage over the nonmusicians. In the music task, none of the musicians met the criterion for absolute pitch. Timbre did not affect how accurately the musical tones were identified. No correlations were found between performance in the Taiwanese task and that in the music task. It was concluded that musicians' advantage in lexical tone perception arose from the ability to track F0 contours. The ability to identify pitch height in lexical tones appears to involve calibrating acoustic input according to gender-specific, internally stored pitch templates.

J	Sevilla, RM				Sevilla, Robert Marcelo			ACOUSTIC PATTERNS IN HONG KONG CANTONESE HESITATION MARKERS: VOWEL QUALITY AND OMNISYLLABIC TONE	JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS				Article								Hesitation markers (HMs) lie somewhere on the dividing line between linguistic and sub-linguistic, evincing at the same time crosslinguistic commonalities as well as language-specific features (Candeaet al.2005; Dingemanse andWoensdregt2020). This study seeks to expand on understanding of these lexically peripheral items by analyzing their acoustic properties in Hong Kong Cantonese (HKCT), including vowel quality and F0. Recent work by Dingemanse and Woensdregt (2020) discusses phoneticsimilarities in HMs across languages, which are constrained by adherence to the phonologies of their respective languages. However, it is unclear how HMs are incorporated into HKCT tonal phonology, which can be characterized as 'omnisyllabic' (Matisoff 1995), every syllable being associated with a lexical tone.The present study gathers acoustic data (F0, F1-F2, duration) from the PolyU Corpus of Spoken Chinese (http://wongtaksum.no-ip.info:81/corpus.htm)across 10 speakers and 196 HMs, comparing them against 525 lexical items. Results for F1-F2 clusteredaround mid-front /epsilon/, which is in line both with around the lower end of the pitch range, approaching Tones 3 and 6, which is expected given effort minimization trends. However, establishing a connection with a particular lexical tone was complicated by the similarity of Tones 3 and 6, which could not be statistically distinguished. Cross-speaker analysis showed considerable variation in F0, indicating that context, intonation, or idiolectal variation may play a substantial role. This has implications for our understanding of how peripheral items likehesitation markers are treated in omnisyllabic tone languages like Cantonese.												0	0											SEP	2024	52	3																					2026-01-16	WOS:001339028600002

Methods: Participants included 33 children with unilateral CIs (with a mean age of 10.4 +/- 2.9 years old and a mean length of CI use of 7.5 +/- 3.0 years). The Standard Chinese version of Lexical Neighborhood Test was implemented in quiet, speech-spectrum-shaped noise (SSN), and four-talker babble (FTB). The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were set at +5 and + 10 dB for both types of maskers. Participants responded by verbally repeating each word they heard and the response was scored as the percentage accuracy of recognition performance. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) fitting, correlational tests, and a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA were conducted on the percent-correct data. Results: Word recognition in quiet was on average 74.5% correct but dropped to 57.3% and 48.8% correct for SSN and FTB at 10 dB SNR, respectively, and 44.4% and 32.6% correct for SSN and FTB at 5 dB SNR, respectively. In both quiet and noise conditions, the participants showed lower recognition accuracy for the hard words than for the easy words. Disyllabic words were recognized with higher accuracy rates than were the monosyllabic words. The GLM analysis revealed that all four tested factors (masker type, SNR, lexical neighborhood feature, and lexical type) showed significant impacts on word recognition in children with CIs. Word recognition scores in the two types of maskers were significantly correlated for the disyllabic words at both SNRs and monosyllabic words at 10 dB SNR. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that the lexical features such as the lexical neighborhood characteristics and lexical type had significant effects on speech recognition performance in both quiet and noise conditions in pediatric CI users. Children with years of experience of CI use still encountered remarkable difficulties in everyday listening environment although their speech recognition in quiet reached relatively desired level. Fluctuating noise, such as speech babbles, caused greater challenge than steady-state noise for speech recognition in children with CIs.												17	17											OCT	2018	113						124	130		10.1016/j.ijporl.2018.07.039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2018.07.039												2026-01-16	WOS:000444666100028
J	Duong, DN; Kenny, DT				Duong Duy Nguyen; Kenny, Dianna T.			Effects of Muscle Tension Dysphonia on Tone Phonation: Acoustic and Perceptual Studies in Vietnamese Female Teachers	JOURNAL OF VOICE				Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Asia Pacific Conference on Speech Language and Hearing	JUL 09-13, 2007	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA					Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a hyperfunctional voice disorder commonly seen in professional voice users. To date, published acoustic studies of this disorder have mainly focused on nontonal language speakers, and no publication has documented its impact on lexical tone characteristics. In this study, we examined whether and how this voice disorder affected acoustically and perceptually the characteristics of tones in Vietnamese teachers. Voice data were obtained from 42 Vietnamese female primary school teachers diagnosed with MTD and 30 vocally healthy teachers. Tonal data were analyzed using Computerized Speech Lab (CSL-4300B) and Speech Analyzer. Parameters analyzed included the two most important acoustic cues in Vietnamese tones, that is, tonal fundamental frequency (F-0) and laryngealization. Tonal F-0 was assessed using a factorial analysis of variance with group and career durations as independent variables. Tonal samples were also perceptually assessed by a panel of native speakers of the same dialect. The results showed that MTD lowered tonal F-0 in high tones and tones with extensive fundamental frequency variation. There was also a significant main effect for career duration; in MTD group, tonal F-0 was lower in teachers with longer career duration. The teachers with MTD showed different patterns of laryngealization compared with the control group. Tone perception was poorer for tones with extensive fundamental frequency variation and without a typical phonation type. The results in this group of teachers supported our hypothesis that MTD impairs lexical tone phonation.												9	13											JUL	2009	23	4					446	459		10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.12.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.12.004												2026-01-16	WOS:000268118200006
J	Tsukada, K; Han, JI				Tsukada, Kimiko; Han, Jeong-Im			The perception of Mandarin lexical tones by native Korean speakers differing in their experience with Mandarin	SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH				Article								While it is well established that non-native speakers differ from native speakers in their perception and/or production of Mandarin lexical tones, empirical studies focusing on non-native learners are still limited. The objective of this study is to add to the current understanding of lexical tone perception by comparing native speakers of standard Korean from the Seoul/Kyunggi area differing in Mandarin experience (NK1, NK2) with native speakers of Mandarin. NK1 (n = 10) had no experience with Mandarin whereas NK2 (n = 10) consisted of highly advanced learners of Mandarin. A group of 10 native Mandarin (NM) speakers was included as controls. Accuracy of perception of six tone pairs (T1-T2, T1-T3, T1-T4, T2-T3, T2-T4, T3-T4) was assessed in a four-alternative forced-choice discrimination test. As expected, the NK2 group with extensive Mandarin learning experience resembled the NM group to a greater extent than did the NK1 group. T2-T3 was the hardest pair for both NK groups, but NK2 had the largest advantage over NK1 for this pair. Apart from T2-T3 which is generally considered difficult, tone pairs involving T1 caused some misperception by the NK groups. This may be related to the difficulty with perceiving a level tone which shows the least fundamental frequency (F0) movement and possibly has limited perceptual salience.												15	16											JUL	2019	35	3					305	318		10.1177/0267658318775155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0267658318775155												2026-01-16	WOS:000471767200001

Mismatch negativity to pitch contours is influenced by language experience	BRAIN RESEARCH				Article								A cross-language study utilizing the mismatch negativity (MMN) evoked response was conducted to explore the influence of language experience on the preattentive cortical processing of linguistically relevant pitch contours. Chinese and English subjects were presented with Mandarin Chinese tones while the mismatch negativity (MMN) response was elicited using a passive oddball paradigm. Two oddball conditions were constructed with a common deviant, a low falling rising contour tone (T3). One condition consisted of two tones that are acoustically similar to one another (T2/T3: T2, high rising contour= standard). The other condition consisted of two tones that are acoustically dissimilar to one another (T1/T3: T1, high level= standard). These tonal pairs enabled us to assess whether different degrees of similarity between pitch movements exert a differential influence on preattentive pitch processing. Results showed that the mean MMN amplitude of the Chinese group was larger than that of the English group for the T1/T3 condition. No group differences were found for the T2/T3 condition. The mean MMN amplitude was larger for the T1/T3 relative to the T2/T3 condition for the Chinese group only. By virtue of these language group differences, we infer that early cortical processing of pitch contours may be shaped by the relative saliency of acoustic dimensions underlying the pitch patterns of a particular language.

J	Chien, PJ; Friederici, AD; Hartwigsen, G; Sammler, D				Chien, Pei-Ju; Friederici, Angela D.; Hartwigsen, Gesa; Sammler, Daniela			Neural correlates of intonation and lexical tone in tonal and non-tonal language speakers	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING				Article								Intonation, the modulation of pitch in speech, is a crucial aspect of language that is processed in right-hemispheric regions, beyond the classical left-hemispheric language system. Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.												27	28											MAY	2020	41	7					1842	1858		10.1002/hbm.24916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24916		JAN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000508026600001

D.; Kulkarni, Aditya M.; Christensen, Julie A.; Limb, Charles J.; Chatterjee, Monita			Deficits in the Sensitivity to Pitch Sweeps by School-Aged Children Wearing Cochlear Implants	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Sensitivity to static changes in pitch has been shown to be poorer in school-aged children wearing cochlear implants (Cis) than children with normal hearing (NH), but it is unclear whether this is also the case for dynamic changes in pitch. Yet, dynamically changing pitch has considerable ecological relevance in terms of natural speech, particularly aspects such as intonation, emotion, or lexical tone information. Twenty one children with NH and 23 children wearing a CI participated in this study, along with 18 NH adults and 6 CI adults for comparison. Listeners with Cls used their clinically assigned settings with envelope-based coding strategies. Percent correct was measured in one- or three-interval two-alternative forced choice tasks, for the direction or discrimination of harmonic complexes based on a linearly rising or falling fundamental frequency. Sweep rates were adjusted per subject, in a logarithmic scale, so as to cover the full extent of the psychometric function. Data for up- and down-sweeps were fitted separately, using a maximum-likelihood technique. Fits were similar for up- and down-sweeps in the discrimination task, but diverged in the direction task because psychometric functions for down-sweeps were very shallow. Hits and false alarms were then converted into d' and beta values, from which a threshold was extracted at a d' of 0.77. Thresholds were very consistent between the two tasks and considerably higher (worse) for CI listeners than for their NH peers. Thresholds were also higher for children than adults. Factors such as age at implantation, age at profound hearing loss, and duration of CI experience did not play any major role in this sensitivity. Thresholds of dynamic pitch sensitivity (in either task) also correlated with thresholds for static pitch sensitivity and with performance in tasks related to speech prosody.												26	27											MAR 3	2016	10								73	10.3389/fnins.2016.00073	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00073												2026-01-16	WOS:000371565200001

The present work examined the effect of F0 contour on speech intelligibility for hearing-impaired listeners for Mandarin Chinese in quiet, in steady noise, and in two-talker competing speech. The intelligibility of two types of natural speech was measured: single-Tone speech with relatively flat F0 contours and multi-Tone speech with time-varying F0 contours. The speech rate and mean F0 of speech materials were carefully controlled to avoid effects other than F0 contour on the speech intelligibility. Results showed that intelligibility was significantly higher for speech with a flat F0 contour than that with a dynamic F0 contour at a low signal-to-masker ratio in both speech-spectrum noise and two-talker masker.												2	3											AUG	2019	146	2					EL85	EL91		10.1121/1.5119264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.5119264												2026-01-16	WOS:000483887400001

All three groups were asked to discriminate pairs of syllables that minimally differed in either Cantonese tone or in English stress. Bilingual children's performance on tone perception was comparable to their performance on stress perception. By contrast, bilingual adults' performance on tone perception was lower than their performance on stress perception, and there was a similar pattern in English monolingual adults. Bilingual adults tended to perform better than English monolingual adults on both the tone and stress perception tests. A significant correlation between tone perception and stress perception performance was found in bilingual children but not in bilingual adults. All three groups showed lower accuracy in the high rising-low rising contrast than any of the other 14 Cantonese tone contrasts. The acoustic analyses revealed that average FO, FO onset, and FO major slope were the critical acoustic correlates of Cantonese tones, whereas multiple acoustic correlates were salient in English stress, including average FO, spectral balance, duration and intensity. We argue that participants' difficulty in perceiving high rising-low rising contrasts originated from the contrasts' similarities in FO onset and average FO; indeed the difference between their major slopes was the only cue with which to distinguish them. Acoustic-perceptual correlation analyses showed that although the average FO and FO onset were associated with tone perception performance in all three groups, FO major slope was only associated with tone perception in the bilingual adult group. These results support a dynamic interactive account of suprasegmental speech perception by emphasizing the positive prosodic transfer between Cantonese tone and English stress, and the role that level of bilingual language experience and age play in shaping suprasegmental speech perception.												33	35											NOV 25	2015	10	11							e0142896	10.1371/journal.pone.0142896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142896												2026-01-16	WOS:000365865300035
J	Köhnlein, B				Kohnlein, Bjorn			Contrastive foot structure in Franconian tone-accent dialects	PHONOLOGY				Article								Franconian has a contrast between two tone accents, commonly referred to as Accent 1 and Accent 2. Traditional autosegmental analyses of the phenomenon suggest that this opposition derives from the presence of lexical tone. In contrast to this 'tonal approach', I argue that the Franconian accent contrast is based on contrastive foot structure - there is no tone in the lexicon. This 'metrical approach' not only accounts for the tonal differences between the accents, but also captures a variety of facts that are hard to incorporate into a synchronic tonal analysis, involving morphological alternations between Accent 1 and Accent 2, as well as the effects of vowel duration, vowel quality and consonant quality on accent-class membership. The metrical analysis of these patterns is in line with similar approaches to tone-accent contrasts in North Germanic and Scottish Gaelic.												20	22											MAY	2016	33	1					87	123		10.1017/S095267571600004X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095267571600004X												2026-01-16	WOS:000378142000003

We investigated whether this deficit extended to pitch processing in speech, notably the pitch changes used to contrast lexical tones in tonal languages. Congenital amusics and matched controls, all non-tonal language speakers, were tested for lexical tone discrimination in Mandarin Chinese (Experiment 1) and in Thai (Experiment 2). Tones were presented in pairs and participants were required to make same/different judgments. Experiment 2 additionally included musical analogs of Thai tones for comparison. Performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls for all materials, suggesting a domain-general pitch-processing deficit. The pitch deficit of amusia is thus not limited to music, but may compromise the ability to process and learn tonal languages. Combined with acoustic analyses of the tone material, the present findings provide new insights into the nature of the pitch-processing deficit exhibited by amusics.												57	58												2011	2								120	10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00120	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00120												2026-01-16	WOS:000208863700131

Incidental Nonspeech Auditory Learning Scaffolds Phonetic, Category, and Word Learning in a Foreign Language Classroom	LANGUAGE LEARNING				Article								There is considerable lab-based evidence for successful incidental learning, in which a learner's attention is directed away from the to-be-learned stimulus and towards another stimulus. In this study, we extend incidental learning research into the language learning classroom. Three groups of adult second language (L2) learners (N = 52) engaged in structured classroom Mandarin learning took part in an 8-week study. One group served as a classroom-only control group. The second group underwent additional intentional auditory training involving Mandarin speech and explicit feedback. The third group underwent additional incidental learning combined with nonspeech "perceptual building block" categories-categories that share critical perceptual dimensions with target L2 speech categories but that are not perceived as speech. We demonstrate that when supplemented with structured classroom learning, incidental learning involving nonspeech analogs promotes phonetic, category, and word learning equivalent to learning from more traditional intentional auditory training.												0	0											DEC	2025	75	4					1091	1121		10.1111/lang.12700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12700		JAN 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001394206200001

Cross-talker lexical tone discrimination in infancy	JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE				Article; Early Access								This study investigated how infants deal with cross-talker variability in the perception of native lexical tones, paying specific attention to developmental changes and the role of task demands. Using the habituation-based visual fixation procedures, we tested Cantonese-learning infants of different age groups on their ability to discriminate Cantonese Tone 1 (high level) and Tone 3 (mid level) produced by either multiple talkers or a single talker. Results demonstrated that the 12-month-old and 24-month-old groups showed reliable discrimination across talkers, whereas the 18-month-old group did not (Experiment 1), despite their ability to discriminate the same contrast when the talker was held constant (Experiment 2). In a task that included a novel object as a referent to the sound, the 18-month-olds discriminated the contrast across talkers from Tone 1 to Tone 3 (Experiment 3). These results revealed a U-shaped developmental path and perceptual asymmetry in native lexical tone discrimination across talkers.

Achieving constancy in spoken word identification: Time course of talker normalization	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								This event-related potential (ERP) study examines the time course of context-dependent talker normalization in spoken word identification. We found three ERP components, the N1 (100-220 ms), the N400 (250-500 ms) and the Late Positive Component (500-800 ms), which are conjectured to involve (a) auditory processing, (b) talker normalization and lexical retrieval, and (c) decisional process/lexical selection respectively. Talker normalization likely occurs in the time window of the N400 and overlaps with the lexical retrieval process. Compared with the nonspeech context, the speech contexts, no matter whether they have semantic content or not, enable listeners to tune to a talker's pitch range. In this way, speech contexts induce more efficient talker normalization during the activation of potential lexical candidates and lead to more accurate selection of the intended word in spoken word identification.

Lexical tone variation and spoken word recognition in preschool children: effects of perceptual salience	JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE				Article								Children undergo gradual progression in their ability to differentiate correct and incorrect pronunciations of words, a process that is crucial to establishing a native vocabulary. For the most part, the development of mature phonological representations has been researched by investigating children's sensitivity to consonant and vowel variation, with a much lesser focus on lexical tones. The current study investigates sensitivity to lexical tones in word recognition with specific attention to role of perceptual salience. Chinese-speaking preschoolers were presented with familiar words that were correctly pronounced, substituted for a subtle tone variant (Tones 2 and 3), or substituted for a salient tone variant (Tones 1 and 4). Results demonstrated that subtle tone variants were mistakenly perceived as correct pronunciations and only salient tone variants were recognized as mispronunciations. Findings suggest that tone integration follows a more complex developmental course that previously concluded.												10	11											JUL	2017	44	4					924	942		10.1017/S0305000916000325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305000916000325												2026-01-16	WOS:000402809000007
J	Luo, X; Ashmore, KB				Luo, Xin; Ashmore, Krista B.			The effect of language experience on perceptual normalization of Mandarin tones and non-speech pitch contours	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Context-dependent pitch perception helps listeners recognize tones produced by speakers with different fundamental frequencies (f0s). The role of language experience in tone normalization remains unclear. In this cross-language study of tone normalization, native Mandarin and English listeners were asked to recognize Mandarin Tone 1 (high-flat) and Tone 2 (mid-rising) with a preceding Mandarin sentence. To further test whether context-dependent pitch perception is speech-specific or domain-general, both language groups were asked to identify non-speech flat and rising pitch contours with a preceding non-speech flat pitch contour. Results showed that both Mandarin and English listeners made more rising responses with non-speech than with speech stimuli, due to differences in spectral complexity and listening task between the two stimulus types. English listeners made more rising responses than Mandarin listeners with both speech and non-speech stimuli. Contrastive context effects (more rising responses in the high-f0 context than in the low-f0 context) were found with both speech and non-speech stimuli for Mandarin listeners, but not for English listeners. English listeners' lack of tone experience may have caused more rising responses and limited use of context f0 cues. These results suggest that context-dependent pitch perception in tone normalization is domain-general, but influenced by long-term language experience.

Two speakers were selected such that lone 2 of the low-pitched speaker and tone 3 of rite high-pitched speaker occurred at equivalent F0 heights. Production and perception experiments determined that turning paint (or inflection point of the tone), and Delta F0 (the difference in F0 between onset and turning point) distinguished the two tones. Three tone continua varying in either turning point, Delta F0, or both acoustic dimensions, were then appended to a natural precursor phrase from each of the two speakers. Results showed identification shifts such that identical stimuli were identified as low tones for the high precursor condition, but as high tones for the low precursor condition, Stimuli varying in turning point showed no significant shift, suggesting that listeners normalize only when the precursor varies in the same dimension as the stimuli, The magnitude of the shift was greater for stimuli varying only in Delta F0, as compared to stimuli varying in both turning point and Delta F0, indicating that normalization effects are reduced for stimuli more closely matching natural speech.

In Experiment 1, participants' explicit affective assessments of Chinese characters with different structures, frequencies, and lexical tones were analyzed. Results indicated that participants showed explicit preferences and dispreferences to different structures and lexical tones. In Experiment 2, participants' implicit responses to different structures and lexical tones were investigated using a metaphor experimental paradigm. Results were consistent with the major findings of Experiment 1. In Experiments 3 and 4, participants' recognition of words of different structures and lexical tones were analyzed.

J	Winskel, H				Winskel, Heather			Insights into reading processes through investigating diversity	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY				Review								The general goal of reading is to obtain meaning from what is written on the page or screen. The numerous scripts around the world used to write different languages vary in terms of what aspects of language are encoded in the written form. The aim of the current review is to examine some recent research on lesser-studied orthographies, in particular Thai, to illustrate the benefits of comparative studies in building a greater understanding of what processes are common or distinct when reading diverse writing systems. Three areas of reading are focused on where there is substantial variation across orthographies: (1) reading with and without interword spaces, (2) flexibility in letter position coding and initial letter position advantage, and (3) the role of lexical tone when reading. In order to effectively read a script, readers need to attend to the critical features of the script that interface with the particular language of the speaker. For example, in scripts with interword spaces, these salient visual cues form clear word boundaries, whereas in unspaced scripts other orthography-specific cues need to be identified and utilised. Furthermore, comparative research shows that letter position encoding varies across languages, which is shaped by the characteristics of the orthography. Finally, research on Thai and Chinese indicates that tone takes a secondary role in comparison to segmental information (consonantal and vowel information) and appears to be processed at a later stage.												2	2											SEP	2017	69	3					151	161		10.1111/ajpy.12136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajpy.12136												2026-01-16	WOS:000409559500001
J	Xu, Y				Xu, Y			Effects of tone and focus on the formation and alignment of f0 contours	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								The present study examines how lexical tone and focus contribute to the formation and alignment off, contours in speech. This was done through an investigation of f(0) contour formation in short Mandarin sentences. These sentences all consisted of five syllables with varying tones on the middle three syllables. The sentences were produced by eight Mandarin speakers with four different focus patterns: focus on the first, second, or last word, or with no narrow focus. The f(0) patterns of these sentences were examined through point-by-point f(0) tracing, graphical comparison of averaged f(0) contours, f(0)-contour-syllable alignment analysis, and analysis of maximum, minimum f(0), and slope of f(0) contours. The results indicate that (a) while the lexical tone of a syllable is the most important determining factor for the local f(0) contour of the syllable, focus extensively modulates the global shape of the f(0) curve, which in turn affects the height and even the shape of local contours; (b) the tones of adjacent syllables also extensively influence both the shape and height of the f(0) contour of a syllable, with the preceding tone exerting more influence than the following tone; (c) despite extensive variations in shape and height, the f(0) contour of a tone remains closely aligned with the associated syllable; and (d) both focus and tonal interaction may generate substantial f(0) decline over the course of an utterance. These findings seem to be able to reduce the unpredictability in the formation and alignment of f(0) contours in speech.

In a between-subjects design, a total of 106 participants with no previous knowledge of Chinese were asked to observe (Experiment 1) and produce (Experiment 2) pitch gestures during a short multimodal training session on Chinese tones and words. In both experiments they were tested on (a) tone identification and (b) word learning. Results showed the positive effect of a training session with pitch gesture observation compared to a training session without it (Experiment 1) and the benefits of producing gestures compared to only observing them and repeating the words aloud (Experiment 2). A comparison of the results of the two experiments revealed that there was no significant difference between the simple observation of pitch gestures and the production of speech accompanied by pitch gestures in facilitating lexical tone identification and word learning. Thus, both perception and production tasks with pitch gestures can be regarded as beneficial learning strategies for the initial stages of tones acquisition in the Chinese as a Second Language classroom.												42	45											MAR	2019	41	1					33	58		10.1017/S0272263118000074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0272263118000074												2026-01-16	WOS:000478989000003

In the current study, we employed the passive oddball paradigm to investigate the effect of blindness on listeners' mismatch responses to Mandarin lexical tones, consonants, and vowels. Twelve blind and twelve sighted age- and verbal IQ-matched adults with normal hearing participated in this study. Our results indicated that blind listeners possibly had a more efficient pre-attentive processing (shorter MMN peak latency) of lexical tones in the tone-dominant hemisphere (i.e., the right hemisphere); and that they exhibited greater sensitivity (larger MMN amplitude) when processing phonemes (consonants and/or vowels) at the pre-attentive stage in both hemispheres compared with sighted individuals. However, we observed longer MMN and P3a peak latencies during phoneme processing in the blind versus control participants, indicating that blind listeners may be slower in terms of pre-attentive processing and involuntary attention switching when processing phonemes. This could be due to a lack of visual experience in the production and perception of phonemes. In a word, the current study revealed a two-sided influence of blindness on Mandarin speech perception.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								The psycholinguistic status of lexical tones and phones is indexed via phonological and tonological awareness (PA and TA, respectively) using Thai speech. In Experiment 1 (Thai participants, alphabetic script and orthographically explicit phones/tones), PA was better than TA in children and primary school-educated adults, and TA improved to PA levels only in tertiary-educated adults. In Experiment 2 (Cantonese participants, logographic script and no orthographically explicit phones/tones), children and primary-educated adults had better PA than TA, and PA and TA were equivalent in tertiary-educated adults, but were nevertheless still below the level of their Thai counterparts. Experiment 3 (English-language participants, alphabetic script and nontonal) showed better PA than TA. Regression analyses showed that both TA and PA are predicted by reading ability for Thai children but by general nonorthographic age-related variables for Cantonese children, whereas for English children reading ability predicts PA but not TA. The results show a phone > tone perceptual advantage over both age and languages that is affected by availability of orthographically relevant information and metalinguistic maturity. More generally, both the perception and the psycholinguistic representation of phones and tones differ. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We examined Australian English listeners' perception and learning of a supra-segmental feature, pitch direction in a non-native tonal contrast, using a passive oddball paradigm and electroencephalography. The stimuli were two contours generated from naturally produced high-level and high-falling tones in Mandarin Chinese, differing only in pitch direction (Liu and Kager, 2014). While both contours had similar pitch onsets, the pitch offset of the falling contour was lower than that of the level one. The contrast was presented in two orientations (standard and deviant reversed) and tested in two blocks with the order of block presentation counterbalanced. Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses showed that listeners discriminated the non-native tonal contrast only in the second block, reflecting indications of learning through exposure during the first block. In addition, listeners showed a later MMN peak for their second block of test relative to listeners who did the same block first, suggesting linguistic (as opposed to acoustic) processing or a misapplication of perceptual strategies from the first to the second block. The results also showed a perceptual asymmetry for change in pitch direction: listeners who encountered a falling tone deviant in the first block had larger frontal MMN amplitudes than listeners who encountered a level tone deviant in the first block. The implications of our findings for second language speech and the developmental trajectory for tone perception are discussed.												15	16											MAR 20	2018	9								162	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00162	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00162												2026-01-16	WOS:000427890700001

In addition, we examined the metalinguistic skills that distinguished those who were poor in reading Chinese from those who were poor in reading English. The prevalence of poor English readers among children identified to be poor in Chinese word recognition across the five participating schools was approximately 42% at Grade 2 and 57% at Grade 5. Across grades, children who were poor readers of both languages tended to have difficulties in phonological and morphological awareness. Poor readers of English only were found to manifest significantly poorer phonological awareness, compared to those who were poor readers of Chinese only; their average tone awareness score was also lower relative to normally developing controls. Apart from indicating possible dissociations between Chinese first language (L1) word reading and English second language (L2) word reading, these findings suggested that the degree to which different metalinguistic skills are important for reading in different writing systems may depend on the linguistic features of the particular writing system.												39	43											MAR-APR	2015	48	2					130	145		10.1177/0022219413492854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022219413492854												2026-01-16	WOS:000349535000003

Neurostimulation and Pupillometry: New Directions for Learning and Research in Applied Linguistics	ANNUAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS				Article								This paper begins by discussing new trends in the use of neurostimulation techniques in cognitive science and learning research, as well as the nascent research on their application in second language learning. To illustrate this, an experiment designed to investigate the impact of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), which is delivered via earbuds, on how learners process and learn Mandarin tones is reported. Pupillometry, which is an index of cognitive effort, is explained and illustrated as one way to assess the impact of tVNS. Participants in the study were native English speakers, naive to tone languages, pseudorandomly assigned to active or control conditions, while balancing for nonlinguistic pitch ability and musical experience. Their performance after tVNS was assessed using a range of more traditional language outcome measures, including accuracy and reaction times from lexical recognition and recall tasks and was triangulated with pupillometry during word-learning to help understand the mechanism through which tVNS operates. Findings are discussed in light of the literatures on lexical tone learning, cognitive effort, and neurostimulation, including specific benefits for learners of tone languages. Recommendations are made for future work on the increasingly popular area of neurostimulation for the field of applied linguistics in the 40th anniversary issue of ARAL.												17	18											MAR	2020	40						56	77	PII S0267190520000069	10.1017/S0267190520000069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0267190520000069												2026-01-16	WOS:000544234500004
J	Kaan, E; Wayland, R; Keil, A				Kaan, Edith; Wayland, Ratree; Keil, Andreas			Changes in Oscillatory Brain Networks after Lexical Tone Training	BRAIN SCIENCES				Article								Learning foreign speech contrasts involves creating new representations of sound categories in memory. This formation of new memory representations is likely to involve changes in neural networks as reflected by oscillatory brain activity. To explore this, we conducted time-frequency analyses of electro-encephalography (EEG) data recorded in a passive auditory oddball paradigm using Thai language tones. We compared native speakers of English (a non-tone language) and native speakers of Mandarin Chinese (a tone language), before and after a two-day laboratory training. Native English speakers showed a larger gamma-band power and stronger alpha-band synchrony across EEG channels than the native Chinese speakers, especially after training. This is compatible with the view that forming new speech categories on the basis of unfamiliar perceptual dimensions involves stronger gamma activity and more coherent activity in alpha-band networks than forming new categories on the basis of familiar dimensions.												11	14											JUN	2013	3	2					757	780		10.3390/brainsci3020757	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci3020757												2026-01-16	WOS:000214902100015

FACTORS INFLUENCING SENSITIVITY TO LEXICAL TONE IN AN ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE Implications for Second Language Learning	STUDIES IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION				Article								This study examined whether musical training, ethnicity, and experience with a natural tone language influenced sensitivity to tone while listening to an artificial tone language. The language was designed with three tones, modeled after level-tone African languages. Participants listened to a 15-min random concatenation of six 3-syllable words. Sensitivity to tone was assessed using minimal pairs differing only in one syllable (nonword task: e.g., to-ka-su compared to ca-fi-to) or only in tone (tone task: e.g., to-ka-su compared to to-ka-su). Proficiency in an East Asian heritage language was the strongest predictor of success on the tone task. Asians without tone language experience were no better than other ethnic groups. We conclude by considering implications for research on second language learning, especially as approached through artificial language learning.												32	35											JUN	2015	37	2			SI		335	357		10.1017/S0272263114000849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0272263114000849												2026-01-16	WOS:000355279700006

Mandarin-speaking mothers were recorded while addressing an adult and their child at two ages (0;7-1;0 and 5;0) to examine the acoustic-phonetic differences between IDS and child-directed speech (CDS). CDS exhibits an exaggeration pattern resembling that of IDS-expanded vowel space, longer vowels, higher pitch and greater lexical tone differences - when compared to ADS. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that the extent Of acoustic exaggeration Is significantly smaller in CDS than in IDS. Age-related changes in maternal speech provide Some Support for the hypothesis that mothers adjust their speech directed toward children as a function of the child's language ability.												73	92											SEP	2009	36	4					909	922		10.1017/S030500090800929X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S030500090800929X												2026-01-16	WOS:000269849100009

A word-object association task revealed that 18-month-old infants succeeded in learning the associations between two nonsense objects paired with two nonsense words minimally distinguished by pitch pattern (Experiment 1). In contrast, 14-month-old infants failed (Experiment 2). Eighteen-month-old infants succeeded even for sounds that contained only the prosodic information (Experiment 3). However, a subsequent experiment revealed that 14-month-old infants succeeded in an easier single word-object task using pitch contrast (Experiment 4). These findings indicate that pitch pattern information is robustly available to 18-month-old Japanese monolingual infants in a minimal pair word-learning situation, but only partially accessible in the same context for 14-month-old infants.												1	1											MAY-JUN	2019	24	3					318	337		10.1111/infa.12279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12279												2026-01-16	WOS:000463026200002

This cross-linguistic study evaluated the performance of imitating Cantonese lexical tones and their non-linguistic (nonspeech) counterparts by Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking children with and without ASD. Acoustic analyses showed that, compared with typically developing peers, children with ASD exhibited increased pitch variations when imitating lexical tones, while performed similarly when imitating the nonspeech counterparts. Furthermore, Mandarin-speaking children with ASD failed to exploit the phonological knowledge of segments to improve the imitation accuracy of non-native lexical tones. These findings help clarify the speech-specific pitch processing atypicality and phonological processing deficit in tone-language-speaking children with ASD.												17	18											MAY	2022	52	5					2325	2343		10.1007/s10803-021-05123-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05123-4		JUN 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000659415100004

Specificity of experience-dependent pitch representation in the brainstem	NEUROREPORT				Article								Crosslanguage comparisons of brainstem-evoked potentials have revealed experience-dependent plasticity in pitch representation for curvilinear f(0) contours representative of Mandarin tones. To assess the tolerance limits of this experience-dependent selectivity, we evaluated cross-linguistically (Chinese, English) the pitch strength and tracking accuracy of linear rising and falling f(0) ramps representative of Mandarin tones 2 and 4. No crosslanguage differences in pitch strength or accuracy were observed for either tone, indicating that stimuli with linear rising/falling ramps elicit homogeneous pitch representations at the level of the brainstem regardless of language experience. We conclude that pitch extraction at the brainstem level is critically dependent on specific dimensions of pitch contours that native speakers have been exposed to in natural speech contexts.												68	85											OCT 23	2006	17	15					1601	1605		10.1097/01.wnr.0000236865.31705.3a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.wnr.0000236865.31705.3a												2026-01-16	WOS:000243756800008

Linguistic status of timbre influences pitch encoding in the brainstem	NEUROREPORT				Article								The aim of this experiment is to assess the effects of the linguistic status of timbre on pitch processing in the brainstem. Brainstem frequency following responses were evoked by the Mandarin high-rising lexical tone superimposed on a native vowel quality ([i]), nonnative vowel quality ([oe]), and iterated rippled noise ( nonspeech). Results revealed that voice fundamental frequency magnitudes were larger when concomitant with a native vowel quality compared with either nonnative vowel quality or nonspeech timbre. Such experience-dependent effects suggest that subcortical sensory encoding of pitch interacts with timbre in the human brainstem. As a consequence, responses of the perceptual system can be differentially shaped to pitch patterns in relation to the linguistic status of their concomitant timbre.

Surface Electromyographic Activity of Extrinsic Laryngeal Muscles in Cantonese Tone Production	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY				Article								Patients after total laryngectomy lose their ability to speak. Electrolarynx is a commonly used electronic device that helps these patients to verbally communicate. However, existing electrolarynx systems do not provide pitch control function, which is critical in speech communication especially for tonal languages. This study investigated the surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity of extrinsic laryngeal muscles in producing speech sounds of different pitches by normal speakers. In particular, the sEMG signals for producing different lexical tones of Cantonese were extracted and analyzed. The experimental results on Cantonese tone production confirmed that the sEMGsignal from sternocleidomastoid muscle can be used to differentiate high-pitch tones from low-pitch tones. This reveals the potential of developing pitch-controlled EL systems for laryngectomees who speak Cantonese and other tonal languages.												7	8											FEB	2016	82	2					287	294		10.1007/s11265-015-1022-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11265-015-1022-4												2026-01-16	WOS:000371299700015

Experience-dependent neural plasticity is sensitive to shape of pitch contours	NEUROREPORT				Article								Language experience is known to modulate the preattentive processing of linguistically relevant pitch contours when presented in the speech domain. To assess if experience-dependent effects are specific to speech, we evaluated the mismatch negativity response to nonspeech homologs (iterated rippled noise) of such curvilinear pitch contours (Mandarin: Tone 1, 'high levels'; Tone 2, 'high rising') by Chinese and English listeners as well as to a pitch contour that was a linear approximation of Tone 2 ('linear ascending ramps). Mandarin speakers showed larger mismatch negativity responses than English to the curvilinear pitch contours only. These results suggest that experience-dependent neural plasticity in early cortical processing of linguistically relevant pitch contours is sensitive to naturally occurring pitch dimensions but not specific to speech per se.												45	58											DEC 3	2007	18	18					1963	1967		10.1097/WNR.0b013e3282f213c5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0b013e3282f213c5												2026-01-16	WOS:000251355300017

Pitch Ability As an Aptitude for Tone Learning	LANGUAGE LEARNING				Article								Tone languages such as Mandarin use voice pitch to signal lexical contrasts, presenting a challenge for second/foreign language (L2) learners whose native languages do not use pitch in this manner. The present study examined components of an aptitude for mastering L2 lexical tone. Native English speakers with no previous tone language experience completed a Mandarin word learning task, as well as tests of pitch ability, musicality, L2 aptitude, and general cognitive ability. Pitch ability measures improved predictions of learning performance beyond musicality, L2 aptitude, and general cognitive ability and also predicted transfer of learning to new talkers. In sum, although certain nontonal measures help predict successful tone learning, the central components of tonal aptitude are pitch-specific perceptual measures.												57	72											DEC	2016	66	4					774	808		10.1111/lang.12159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12159												2026-01-16	WOS:000388581800002

Unreal words, real competition: Mandarin recognition slows for syllable-matched tonal gaps	FRONTIERS IN LANGUAGE SCIENCES				Article								Word recognition in tone languages like Mandarin is influenced not only by phonological structure but also by lexical tone. Prior research using auditory lexical decision tasks has shown that real monosyllables are generally processed more quickly and accurately than tonal gaps i.e., impossible syllable-tone combinations. However, these studies often did not control for syllable overlap between tonal gaps and real monosyllables, potentially underestimating lexical competition effects. The present study addressed this gap by contrasting real monosyllables, syllable-matched tonal gaps, and syllable-unmatched tonal gaps in a controlled auditory lexical decision task with 54 native Mandarin speakers. Results revealed that reaction times were significantly faster and accuracy higher for real monosyllables compared to both syllable-matched tonal gaps and syllable-unmatched tonal gaps. More importantly, syllable-matched tonal gaps elicited slower reaction times than syllable-unmatched tonal gaps, indicating increased lexical competition when tonal gaps share the same syllable as real monosyllables. These findings emphasize the critical role of phonological similarity and lexical competition in Mandarin word recognition. By controlling syllabic overlap, this study improves upon previous methodologies and offers a clearer assessment of auditory word processing in tone languages.												0	0											DEC 2	2025	4								1714072	10.3389/flang.2025.1714072	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/flang.2025.1714072												2026-01-16	WOS:001634248100001

The effect of tone hyperarticulation in Cantonese infant-directed speech on toddlers' word recognition in the second year of life	FIRST LANGUAGE				Article								The acoustic properties of infant-directed speech (IDS) have been widely studied, but whether and how young learners' language development benefits from individual properties remains to be confirmed. This study investigated whether toddlers' word processing was affected by tone hyperarticulation in the IDS of a tone language. Nineteen- and 23-month-old Cantonese-learning toddlers completed a familiar word recognition task and were tested (a) in the hyperarticulated-tone (HT) condition in which the tonal distances were exaggerated, and (b) in the non-hyperarticulated-tone (NT) condition with smaller tonal distances that resembled those in adult-directed speech. The 19-month-old toddlers performed significantly better in the HT condition than in the NT condition, while the 23-month-olds performed comparably well in both conditions. These findings suggest that tone language learners' word recognition can be facilitated by tone hyperarticulation in IDS, in the middle of the second year of life; as their language development proceeds, this facilitatory effect appears to largely diminish by the end of the second year of life.												4	4											OCT	2022	42	5					670	692		10.1177/01427237221109342	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01427237221109342		JUL 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000825828000001
J	Yan, HB; Chien, YF; Zhang, J				Yan, Hanbo; Chien, Yu-Fu; Zhang, Jie			The representation of variable tone sandhi patterns in Shanghai Wu	LABORATORY PHONOLOGY				Article								Disyllabic verb-noun (V-N) items in Shanghai Wu have variable surface tone patterns: They can undergo either a rightward extension tone sandhi, which extends the lexical tone of the first syllable over the entire word, or tonal reduction on the first syllable. The current study investigates how the phonological properties of these alternation processes as well as variation influence how Shanghai speakers represent and access such words. We conducted an auditoryauditory priming lexical decision experiment on Shanghai V-N items that can undergo either tonal extension or tonal reduction with native Shanghai speakers. Each disyllabic target was preceded by monosyllabic primes with the canonical tone, the tonal-extension tone, the surface tone, or a tone unrelated to the tone of the first syllable of the targets. Results showed both canonical and tonal-extension priming effects, but no surface priming effect. Moreover, although more familiar V-Ns were recognized with shorter reaction time, the priming effect did not interact with speakers' familiarity ratings or sandhi preference ratings of the targets. These data are consistent with the interpretation that both the canonical and tonal-extension forms are represented in Shanghai speakers' mental lexicon due to tone sandhi variation, but the representation does not seem to be modulated by the frequencies of the variants. Also, together with findings from auditory priming studies of other tone sandhi patterns, the current study suggests that certain phonological properties of an alternation, such as its locality and transparency, influence the representation of words undergoing the alternation; but whether the alternation is structure-preserving does not seem to impact the representation.												4	4											AUG 11	2021	12	1							15	10.5334/labphon.264	http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/labphon.264												2026-01-16	WOS:000684261900001

J.; Nakayama, Mariko			Cognate Translation Priming With Chinese-Japanese Bilinguals: No Effect of Interlingual Phonological Similarity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION				Article								Previous masked translation priming studies, especially those with different-script bilinguals, have shown that cognates provide more priming than noncognates, a difference attributed to cognates' phonological similarity. In our experiments employing a word naming task, we examined this issue for Chinese-Japanese bilinguals in a slightly different way, using same-script cognates as primes and targets. In Experiment 1, significant cognate priming effects were observed. The sizes of the priming effects were, however, statistically not different for phonologically similar (e.g.,../xin4lai4/-../shiNrai/) and dissimilar cognate pairs (e.g.,.. /bao3zheng4/-.. /hoshoR/), suggesting no impact of phonological similarity. In Experiment 2, using exclusively Chinese stimuli, we demonstrated a significant homophone priming effect using two-character logographic primes and targets, indicating that phonological priming is possible for two-character Chinese targets. However, priming only emerged for pairs that had the same tone pattern (e.g.,../shou3wei4/-../shou3wei4/), suggesting that a match in lexical tone is crucial for observing phonologically based priming in that situation. Therefore, Experiment 3 involved phonologically similar Chinese-Japanese cognate pairs in which the similarity of their suprasegmental phonological features (i.e., lexical tone and pitch-accent information) was varied. Priming effects were statistically not different for tone/accent similar pairs (e.g.,../ guan1xin1/-../kaNsiN/) and dissimilar pairs (e.g.,../man3zu2/-.. /maNzoku/). Our results indicate that phonological facilitation is not involved in producing cognate priming effects for Chinese-Japanese bilinguals. Possible explanations, based on underlying representations of logographic cognates, are discussed.												6	6											NOV	2023	49	11					1823	1843		10.1037/xlm0001240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xlm0001240		APR 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000970267200001
J	Francis, AL; Ciocca, V; Wong, VKM; Chan, JKL				Francis, Alexander L.; Ciocca, Valter; Wong, Virginia Ka Man; Chan, Jess Ka Lam			Is fundamental frequency a cue to aspiration in initial stops?	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								One production and one perception experiment were conducted to investigate the interaction of consonant voicing and fundamental frequency at, the onset of voicing (onset f(0)) in Cantonese, a tonal language. Consonantal voicing in English can affect onset f(0) up to 100 ms after voicing onset, but existing research provides inconclusive information regarding the effects of voicing on f(0) in tonal languages where f(0) variability is constrained by the demands of the lexical tone system. Previous research on consonantal effects on onset f(0) provides two contrasting theories: These effects may be automatic, resulting from physiological constraints inherent to the speech production mechanism or they may be controlled, produced as part of a process of cue enhancement for the perception of laryngeal contrasts. Results of experiment 1 showed that consonant aspiration affects onset f(0) in Cantonese only within the first 10 ms following voicing onset, comparable to results for other tonal languages. Experiment 2 showed that Cantonese listeners can use differences in onset f(0) to cue perception of the voicing contrast, but the minimum extent of f(0) perturbation necessary for this is greater than is found in Cantonese production, and comparable to that observed in acoustic studies of nontonal languages. These results suggest that consonantal effects on onset f(0) are at least partially controlled by talkers, but that their role in the perception of voicing/aspiration may be a consequence of language independent properties of audition rather than listeners' experience with the phonological contrasts of a specific language.

J	Sun, KC; Huang, T				Sun, Kuo-Chan; Huang, Tsan			A cross-linguistic study of Taiwanese tone perception by Taiwanese and English listeners	JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN LINGUISTICS				Article								The present study investigated tone perception by speakers of Taiwanese Southern Min and those of American English with an AX discrimination task. Two Taiwanese Southern Min tone continua were constructed from natural speech stimuli. One continuum ranged from a high level tone (T55) to a mid level tone (T33), and the other from a high level (T55) to a high falling tone (T51). The results showed that perception by Taiwanese listeners was quasi-categorical for the contour-level tone continuum but mostly continuous for the level tone-level tone one. This suggests that the findings by Abramson (J Acoust Soc Am 61:S66, 1979a; In: Lindblom B, A-hman S (eds) Frontiers of speech communication, 1979b) and Wang (Ann N Y Acad Sci 280:61-72, 1976) and Chan et al. (J Acoust Soc Am 58:S119, 1975) should be seen as complementary to each other rather than contradictory. Differences on tone perception between Taiwanese and English listeners were also found. Taiwanese listeners exhibited a region of higher discriminability on the T55-T51 continuum, while no discrimination peak was observed in English listeners' data. In addition, Taiwanese listeners were more accurate than English listeners in tone discrimination. These results indicate a qualitative difference in lexical tone perception between tone and nontone language listeners: tone language listeners appear to perceive tones as phonemic categories, utilizing cues such as pitch contour, while nontone language listeners rely more on psychoacoustic factors such as pitch height (cf. Hume and Johnson, In: Hume E, Johnson K (eds) The role of perception in phonology, 2001; Hall, et al., J Phonet, 32:395-421, 2004; Huang, In: Trouvain J, Barry W (eds) Proceedings of the 16th international congress of phonetic science, 2007; Huang and Johnson, Phonetica 67:243-267, 2010).												16	25											AUG	2012	21	3					305	327		10.1007/s10831-012-9092-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10831-012-9092-9												2026-01-16	WOS:000305688900003

Cantonese-Speaking Children Do Not Acquire Tone Perception before Tone Production-A Perceptual and Acoustic Study of Three-Year-Olds' Monosyllabic Tones	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Models of phonological development assume that speech perception precedes speech production and that children acquire suprasegmental features earlier than segmental features. Studies of Chinese-speaking children challenge these assumptions. For example, Chinese-speaking children can produce tones before two-and-a-half years but are not able to discriminate the same tones until after 6 years of age. This study compared the perception and production of monosyllabic Cantonese tones directly in 3 -year-old children. Twenty children and their mothers identified Cantonese tones in a picture identification test and produced monosyllabic tones in a picture labeling task. To control for lexical biases on tone ratings, the mother-and child-productions were low-pass filtered to eliminate lexical information and were presented to five judges for tone classification. Detailed acoustic analysis was performed. Contrary to the view that children master lexical tones earlier than segmental phonemes, results showed that 3-year-old children could not perceive or produce any Cantonese tone with adult-like proficiency and incorrect tone productions were acoustically different from criterion. In contrast to previous findings that Cantonese-speaking children mastered tone production before tone perception, we observed more accuracy during speech perception than production. Findings from Cantonese-speaking children challenge some of the established tenets in theories of phonological development that have been tested mostly with native English speakers.												20	24											AUG 29	2017	8								1450	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01450	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01450												2026-01-16	WOS:000408710200002

W.; Jongman, Allard; Sereno, Joan A.; Wang, Yue			Multi-modal cross-linguistic perception of Mandarin tones in clear speech	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Clearly enunciated speech (relative to conversational, plain speech) involves articulatory and acoustic modifications that enhance auditory-visual (AV) segmental intelligibility. However, little research has explored clear-speech effects on the perception of suprasegmental properties such as lexical tone, particularly involving visual (facial) perception. Since tone production does not primarily rely on vocal tract configurations, tones may be less visually distinctive. Questions thus arise as to whether clear speech can enhance visual tone intelligibility, and if so, whether any intelligibility gain can be attributable to tone-specific category-enhancing (code-based) clear-speech cues or tone-general saliency-enhancing (signal-based) cues. The present study addresses these questions by examining the identification of clear and plain Mandarin tones with visual-only, auditory-only, and AV input modalities by native (Mandarin) and nonnative (English) perceivers. Results show that code-based visual and acoustic clear tone modifications, although limited, affect both native and nonnative intelligibility, with category-enhancing cues increasing intelligibility and category-blurring cues decreasing intelligibility. In contrast, signal-based cues, which are extensively available, do not benefit native intelligibility, although they contribute to nonnative intelligibility gain. These findings demonstrate that linguistically relevant visual tonal cues are existent. In clear speech, such tone category-enhancing cues are incorporated with saliency-enhancing cues across AV modalities for intelligibility improvements.												3	3											SEP 27	2023	17								1247811	10.3389/fnhum.2023.1247811	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2023.1247811												2026-01-16	WOS:001078615300001
J	Ou, JH; Law, SP				Ou, Jinghua; Law, Sam-Po			Induced gamma oscillations index individual differences in speech sound perception and production	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Auditory neuroscience has provided strong evidence that neural oscillations synchronize to the rhythm of speech stimuli, and oscillations at different frequencies have been linked to processing of different language structures. The present study aims to examine how these ubiquitous neurophysiological attributes may inform us about the brain processes that underpin individual differences in speech perception and production, which in turn elucidate the specific functions of neural oscillations in the domain of speech processing. To this end, we recorded electrophysiological responses to a lexical tone contrast in a passive auditory oddball paradigm from two groups of healthy tone-language speakers who were equal in perceptual discriminability but differed in response latency and production distinctiveness of the tone contrast. Time-frequency analysis was applied to the EEG data, and decomposed into theta (4-7 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency bands. Results show that listeners with longer discrimination RT and less distinctive production showed significantly higher induced (non-phase-locked) gamma during tone processing. Moreover, among speakers with less distinctive production, individual differences in induced gamma were significantly correlated with discrimination latency and production distinction. Based on the present findings, we propose that differences in gamma oscillations reflect differential sensory/perceptual computations during acoustic encoding, impacting the quality of perceptual representations, which further mediates individual differences in speech perception and production.												5	10											DEC	2018	121						28	36		10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.10.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.10.028												2026-01-16	WOS:000460855700004
J	Ou, SC				Ou, Shu-chen			The role of lexical stress in spoken English word recognition by listeners of English and Taiwan Mandarin	LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS				Article								Two perceptual experiments investigated how the suprasegmental information of monosyllables is perceived and exploited in spoken English word recognition by listeners of English and Taiwan Mandarin (TM). Using an auditory lexical decision task in which correctly stressed English words and mis-stressed nonwords (e.g. camPAIGN vs. *CAMpaign) were presented for lexical decisions, Experiment I demonstrated that TM listeners could perceive the differences between stressed and unstressed syllables with native-like accuracy and rapidity. To examine how the perceived suprasegmental contrast would constrain English lexical access, Experiment II was conducted. It used a cross-modal fragment priming task in which a lexical decision had to be made for a visually presented English word or nonword following an auditory prime, which was a spoken word-initial syllable. The results showed that English and TM listeners recognized the displayed word (e.g. campus) faster both after a stress-matching (e.g. CAM-) prime and a stress-mismatching (e.g. cam-) prime than after a control prime (e.g. MOUN , with mismatching segments). This indicates that suprasegmental information does not inhibit a segmentally matching but suprasegmentally mismatching word candidate for both the two groups, although TM is a language where lexical prosody is expressed syllabically and its listeners tend to interpret lexical stress tonally. Yet, the two groups' responses were slower after the stressed primes than after the unstressed ones, presumably because the former generally had more possible continuations than the latter do. It is therefore concluded that when recognizing spoken English words, both the native and non-native (TM-speaking) listeners can exploit the suprasegmental cues of monosyllables, which, however, are not so effective that they will outweigh the segmental cues.												3	4												2019	20	4					569	600		10.1075/lali.00049.ou	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/lali.00049.ou												2026-01-16	WOS:000496239100003
J	Rhee, N; Chen, AJ; Kuang, JJ				Rhee, Nari; Chen, Aoju; Kuang, Jianjing			Musicality and Age Interaction in Tone Development	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Vocal pitch, which involves not only F0 but also multiple covarying acoustic cues is central to linguistic perception and production at various levels of prosodic structure. Recent studies on language development have shown that differences in learners' musicality affect the F0 cue development in perception of sentence-level intonation or in prosodic realization of focus. This study aims to contribute toward a fuller understanding of the effect of musicality on linguistic pitch development via a close investigation of the relationship between musicality, age, and lexical tone production covering both F0 and spectral cues in children. Forty-three native Mandarin-speaking children between the ages of 4 and 6 years are recruited to participate in both a semi-spontaneous tone production task and a musicality test. For each age (4, 5, and 6 years) and musicality (below or above the median score of each age group) group, the contrastivity of the four tones is evaluated by performing automatic tone classification using three sets of acoustic cues (F0, spectral cues, and both). It has been found that higher musicality is associated with higher contrastivity of the tones produced at the age of 4 and 5 years, but not at the age of 6 years. These results suggest that musicality promotes earlier development of tone production only in earlier stages of prosodic development; by the age of 6 years, the musicality advantage in tone production subsides.												4	4											FEB 21	2022	16								804042	10.3389/fnins.2022.804042	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.804042												2026-01-16	WOS:000766956500001

Relative influence of musical and linguistic experience on early cortical processing of pitch contours	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								To assess domain specificity of experience-dependent pitch representation we evaluated the mismatch negativity (MMN) and discrimination judgments of English musicians, English nonmusicians, and native Chinese for pitch contours presented in a nonspeech context using a passive oddball paradigm. Stimuli consisted of homologues of Mandarin high rising (T2) and high level (T1) tones, and a linear rising ramp (T2L). One condition involved a between-category contrast (T1/T2), the other, a within-category contrast (T2L/T2). Irrespective of condition, musicians and Chinese showed larger MMN responses than nonmusicians; Chinese larger than musicians. Chinese, however, were less accurate than nonnatives in overt discrimination of T2L and T2. Taken together, these findings suggest that experience-dependent effects to pitch contours are domain-general and not driven by linguistic categories. Yet specific differences in long-term experience in pitch processing between domains (music vs. language) may lead to gradations in cortical plasticity to pitch contours. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Language experience during the sensitive period narrows infants' sensory encoding of lexical tones-Music intervention reverses it	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								The sensitive period for phonetic learning (6 similar to 12 months), evidenced by improved native speech processing and declined non-native speech processing, represents an early milestone in language acquisition. We examined the extent that sensory encoding of speech is altered by experience during this period by testing two hypotheses: (1) early sensory encoding of non-native speech declines as infants gain native-language experience, and (2) music intervention reverses this decline. We longitudinally measured the frequency-following response (FFR), a robust indicator of early sensory encoding along the auditory pathway, to a Mandarin lexical tone in 7- and 11-months-old monolingual English-learning infants. Infants received either no intervention (language-experience group) or music intervention (music-intervention group) randomly between FFR recordings. The language-experience group exhibited the expected decline in FFR pitch-tracking accuracy to the Mandarin tone, while the music-intervention group did not. Our results support both hypotheses and demonstrate that both language and music experiences alter infants' speech encoding.												5	5											JUL 9	2022	16								941853	10.3389/fnhum.2022.941853	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.941853												2026-01-16	WOS:000843929500001

Taiwanese-speaking musicians were asked to identify musical tones without a reference pitch and multispeaker Taiwanese level tones without acoustic cues typically present for speaker normalization. The results showed that a high percentage of the participants (65% with an exact match required and 81% with one-semitone errors allowed) possessed absolute pitch, as measured by the musical tone identification task. A negative correlation was found between occurrence of absolute pitch and age of onset of musical training, suggesting that the acquisition of absolute pitch resembles the acquisition of speech. The participants were able to identify multispeaker Taiwanese level tones with above-chance accuracy, even though the acoustic cues typically present for speaker normalization were not available in the stimuli. No correlations were found between the performance in musical tone identification and the performance in Taiwanese tone identification. Potential reasons for the lack of association between the two tasks are discussed. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

The Influence of Tone Inventory on ERP without Focal Attention: A Cross-Language Study	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE				Article								This study investigates the effect of tone inventories on brain activities underlying pitch without focal attention. We find that the electrophysiological responses to across-category stimuli are larger than those to within-category stimuli when the pitch contours are superimposed on nonspeech stimuli; however, there is no electrophysiological response difference associated with category status in speech stimuli. Moreover, this category effect in nonspeech stimuli is stronger for Cantonese speakers. Results of previous and present studies lead us to conclude that brain activities to the same native lexical tone contrasts are modulated by speakers' language experiences not only in active phonological processing but also in automatic feature detection without focal attention. In contrast to the condition with focal attention, where phonological processing is stronger for speech stimuli, the feature detection (pitch contours in this study) without focal attention as shaped by language background is superior in relatively regular stimuli, that is, the nonspeech stimuli. The results suggest that Cantonese listeners outperform Mandarin listeners in automatic detection of pitch features because of the denser Cantonese tone system.												20	22												2014	2014								961563	10.1155/2014/961563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/961563												2026-01-16	WOS:000344093000001

The present work examined the effect of lexical Tone contrast on concurrent-vowels identification for both normal-hearing (NH) and sensorineural-hearing-loss (SNHL) listeners. To ensure listeners utilize the primary cues of Tone perception, e.g. F0 contour, acoustic cues of mean F0 and durations were controlled for the speech stimuli. The result showed that benefit from Tone contrast existed for NH listeners, but was weak for SNHL listeners. Further analysis based on the measurement of Tone contrast suggested that F0 contour contrast and temporal envelope contrast were both highly correlated with identification performance for each of the listener groups. However, the importance of F0 contour was bigger than that of temporal envelope, especially for NH listeners. These findings would have implications for developing speech processing strategies for Mandarin-native SNHL listeners. (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Hirzel Verlag . EAA.

J	Vouloumanos, A				Vouloumanos, Athena			Voulez-vous jouer avec moi? Twelve-month-olds understand that foreign languages can communicate	COGNITION				Article								Infants understand that speech in their native language allows speakers to communicate. Is this understanding limited to their native language or does it extend to non-native languages with which infants have no experience? Twelve-month-old infants saw an actor, the Communicator, repeatedly select one of two objects. When the Communicator could no longer reach the target but a Recipient could, the Communicator vocalized a nonsense phrase either in English (infants' native language), Spanish (rhythmically different), or Russian (phonotactically different), or hummed (a non-speech vocalization). Across all three languages, native and non-native, but not humming, infants looked longer when the Recipient gave the Communicator the non-target object. Although, by 12 months, infants do not readily map non-native words to objects or discriminate most non-native speech contrasts, they understand that non-native languages can transfer information to others. Understanding language as a tool for communication extends beyond infants' native language: By 12 months, infants view language as a universal mechanism for transferring and acquiring new information.												11	12											APR	2018	173						87	92		10.1016/j.cognition.2018.01.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2018.01.002												2026-01-16	WOS:000425571700010
J	Ip, MHK; Cutler, A				Ip, Martin Ho Kwan; Cutler, Anne			Universals of listening: Equivalent prosodic entrainment in tone and non-tone languages	COGNITION				Article								In English and Dutch, listeners entrain to prosodic contours to predict where focus will fall in an utterance. Here, we ask whether this strategy is universally available, even in languages with very different phonological systems (e.g., tone versus non-tone languages). In a phoneme detection experiment, we examined whether prosodic entrainment also occurs in Mandarin Chinese, a tone language, where the use of various suprasegmental cues to lexical identity may take precedence over their use in salience. Consistent with the results from Germanic languages, response times were facilitated when preceding intonation predicted high stress on the target-bearing word, and the lexical tone of the target word (i.e., rising versus falling) did not affect the Mandarin listeners' response. Further, the extent to which prosodic entrainment was used to detect the target phoneme was the same in both English and Mandarin listeners. Nevertheless, native Mandarin speakers did not adopt an entrainment strategy when the sentences were presented in English, consistent with the suggestion that L2 listening may be strained by additional functional load from prosodic processing. These findings have implications for how universal and language-specific mechanisms interact in the perception of focus structure in everyday discourse.												22	24											SEP	2020	202								104311	10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104311												2026-01-16	WOS:000551338900012

This study investigated the nature of these difficulties and how first language (L1) cue-weighting strategies transfer to L2 processing among Chinese (Mandarin)-English learners. The rising pitch that cues English phrase boundaries acoustically overlaps with functionally distinct Chinese lexical tones. Through two experiments comparing Chinese-English learners and native English speakers, we assessed sensitivity across lexical constituent, phrase, and sentence boundaries and manipulated acoustic cues (pause, lengthening, pitch) to estimate their perceptual weights during phrase-boundary identification. L2 learners showed reduced discrimination sensitivity only at the phrase level, performing comparably to native speakers at lexical constituent and sentence boundaries. For phrase boundaries, learners over-relied on pitch and under-relied on pre-boundary lengthening compared to native speakers, though both groups weighted pauses strongly. This selective deficit implicates the transfer of L1 cue-weighting strategies more than a global knowledge deficit. Our findings support a dynamic transfer model where L1 sensitivity to lexical tone transfer of L2 phrase perception, elevating the weight of pitch. While learners show partial adaptation, these results refine the Cue-Weighting Transfer Hypothesis by demonstrating that L2 prosodic acquisition involves both integrated L1 transfer and L2-driven reweighting strategies.												0	0											NOV 21	2025	15	12							1605	10.3390/bs15121605	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bs15121605												2026-01-16	WOS:001646947700001
J	Zhang, H; Ding, HW; Lee, WS				Zhang, Hui; Ding, Hongwei; Lee, Wai-Sum			The influence of preceding speech and nonspeech contexts on Mandarin tone identification	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study examines the effect of preceding tones on tone perception within Mandarin disyllabic utterances and the underlying mechanism that causes such an effect. Listeners were presented with a series of tone targets varying perceptually from Mandarin Tone 3 to Tone 4 following Tone 1, Tone 2, or Tone 4. The results showed that the targets were more likely to be categorized as Tone 3 following the context tones with high offset f0 (Tone 1 and Tone 2) than following those with low offset f0 (Tone 4). The effect of preceding tones compensated for the acoustic consequence of coarticulation because the context tone with high offset f0 produced Tone 4-like Tone 3 variant in production, but tended to elicit Tone 3 identification of this variant in perception. Moreover, we also observed an effect of nonspeech contexts that preserved only the f0 contours of speech contexts. However, the effect of nonspeech contexts was significantly smaller than that of speech contexts, and the difference was not caused by focal attention.

J	Cooper, A; Wang, Y				Cooper, Angela; Wang, Yue			The influence of linguistic and musical experience on Cantonese word learning	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Adult non-native speech perception is subject to influence from multiple factors, including linguistic and extralinguistic experience such as musical training. The present research examines how linguistic and musical factors influence non-native word identification and lexical tone perception. Groups of native tone language (Thai) and non-tone language listeners (English), each subdivided into musician and non-musician groups, engaged in Cantonese tone word training. Participants learned to identify words minimally distinguished by five Cantonese tones during training, also completing musical aptitude and phonemic tone identification tasks. First, the findings suggest that either musical experience or a tone language background leads to significantly better non-native word learning proficiency, as compared to those with neither musical training nor tone language experience. Moreover, the combination of tone language and musical experience did not provide an additional advantage for Thai musicians above and beyond either experience alone. Musicianship was found to be more advantageous than a tone language background for tone identification. Finally, tone identification and musical aptitude scores were significantly correlated with word learning success for English but not Thai listeners. These findings point to a dynamic influence of musical and linguistic experience, both at the tone dentification level and at the word learning stage. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

J	Ong, JH; Wong, PCM; Liu, F				Ong, Jia Hoong; Wong, Patrick C. M.; Liu, Fang			Musicians show enhanced perception, but not production, of native lexical tones	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Many studies have reported a musical advantage in perceiving lexical tones among non-native listeners, but it is unclear whether this advantage also applies to native listeners, who are likely to show ceiling-like performance and thus mask any potential musical advantage. The ongoing tone merging phenomenon in Hong Kong Cantonese provides a unique opportunity to investigate this as merging tone pairs are reported to be difficult to differentiate even among native listeners. In the present study, native Cantonese musicians and non-musicians were compared based on discrimination and identification of merging Cantonese tone pairs to determine whether a musical advantage in perception will be observed, and if so, whether this is seen on the phonetic and/or phonological level. The tonal space of the subjects' lexical tone production was also compared. Results indicated that the musicians outperformed the non-musicians on the two perceptual tasks, as indexed by a higher accuracy and faster reaction time, particularly on the most difficult tone pair. In the production task, however, there was no group difference in various indices of tonal space. Taken together, musical experience appears to facilitate native listeners' perception, but not production, of lexical tones, which partially supports a music-to-language transfer effect.

Unequal effects of speech and nonspeech contexts on the perceptual normalization of Cantonese level tones	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Context is important for recovering language information from talker-induced variability in acoustic signals. In tone perception, previous studies reported similar effects of speech and nonspeech contexts in Mandarin, supporting a general perceptual mechanism underlying tone normalization. However, no supportive evidence was obtained in Cantonese, also a tone language. Moreover, no study has compared speech and nonspeech contexts in the multi-talker condition, which is essential for exploring the normalization mechanism of inter-talker variability in speaking F0. The other question is whether a talker's full F0 range and mean F0 equally facilitate normalization. To answer these questions, this study examines the effects of four context conditions (speech/nonspeech x F0 contour/mean F0) in the multi-talker condition in Cantonese. Results show that raising and lowering the F0 of speech contexts change the perception of identical stimuli from mid level tone to low and high level tone, whereas nonspeech contexts only mildly increase the identification preference. It supports the speech-specific mechanism of tone normalization. Moreover, speech context with flattened F0 trajectory, which neutralizes cues of a talker's full F0 range, fails to facilitate normalization in some conditions, implying that a talker's mean F0 is less efficient for minimizing talker-induced lexical ambiguity in tone perception.

However, cochlear implant (CI) users experience difficulties in segregating speech signals in multitalker environments in part due to the coarse spectral resolution. The present study examined how the vocal characteristics of the target and masking talkers influence listeners' ability to extract information from a target phrase in a multitalker environment. Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured with one, two, or four masker talkers for different combinations of target-masker vocal characteristics in 10 adult Mandarin-speaking NH listeners and 12 adult Mandarin-speaking CI users. The results showed that CI users performed significantly poorer than NH listeners in the presence of competing talkers. As the number of masker talkers increased, the mean SRTs significantly worsened from -22.0 dB to -5.2 dB for NH listeners but significantly improved from 5.9 dB to 2.8 dB for CI users. The results suggest that the flattened peaks and valleys with increased numbers of competing talkers may reduce NH listeners' ability to use dips in the spectral and temporal envelopes that allow for "glimpses" of the target speech. However, the flattened temporal envelope of the resultant masker signals may be less disruptive to the amplitude contour of the target speech, which is important for Mandarin-speaking CI users' lexical tone recognition. The amount of masking release was further estimated by comparing SRTs between the same-sex maskers and the different-sex maskers. There was a large amount of masking release in NH adults (12 dB) and a small but significant amount of masking release in CI adults (2 dB). These results suggest that adult CI users may significantly benefit from voice pitch differences between target and masker speech.												14	14											APR	2020	24								2331216520916106	10.1177/2331216520916106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2331216520916106												2026-01-16	WOS:000529939600001

Post exclusion, 95 native-language Mandarin speakers produced as many items that differed by a single lexical tone as possible within one minute. Their verbal productions were assessed according to several novel graded fluency measures, and network science measures that accounted for the structure, cohesion and interconnectedness of lexical items. A multivariate regression analysis of our participants' language backgrounds included their mono- or multi-lingual status, English proficiency, and fluency in other Chinese languages/dialects. Higher English proficiency predicted lower error rates and greater interconnectedness, while higher fluency in other Chinese languages/dialects revealed lower successive similarity and lower network coherence. This inverse relationship between English and other Chinese languages/dialects provides evidence of the restructuring of the phonological mental lexicon.												10	10											NOV 5	2019	9								15984	10.1038/s41598-019-52433-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52433-w												2026-01-16	WOS:000494258500004

Here we investigate whether the human brain automatically extracts the phonological information in visual words in early visual processing. We continuously presented native Chinese speakers peripherally with Chinese homophone characters in an oddball paradigm, while they performed a visual detection task presented in the centre of the visual field. We found the lexical tone phonology embedded in the characters is processed automatically by the brain of native speakers, as revealed by whole-head electrical recordings of the mismatch negativity (MMN). Source solution further revealed the MMN involved the neural activations from the visual cortex to the auditory cortex (130-460 ms). The spatial-temporal dynamics indicate a visual-auditory interaction in the early, automatic processing of phonological information in visual words.												8	8											DEC 12	2013	3								3485	10.1038/srep03485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep03485												2026-01-16	WOS:000328503800002

Methods Two hundred seventy-eight prelingually deafened children with CIs and 173 age-matched normal-hearing (NH) children participated in the study. Thirty-six monosyllabic Mandarin Chinese words were recorded from each subject. The fundamental frequencies (F0) were extracted from the tone tokens. Two acoustic measures (i.e., differentiability and hit rate) were computed based on the F0 onset and offset values (i.e., the tone ellipses of the two-dimensional [2D] method) or the F0 onset, midpoint, and offset values (i.e., the tone ellipsoids of the 3D method). The correlations between the acoustic measures as well as between the methods were performed. The relationship between demographic factors and acoustic measures were also explored. Results The children with CIs showed significantly poorer performance in tone differentiability and hit rate than the NH children. For both CI and NH groups, performance on the two acoustic measures was highly correlated with each other (r values: 0.895-0.961). The performance between the two methods (i.e., 2D and 3D methods) was also highly correlated (r values: 0.774-0.914). Age at implantation and duration of CI use showed a weak correlation with the scores of acoustic measures under both methods. These two factors jointly accounted for 15.4-18.9% of the total variance of tone production performance. Conclusion There were significant deficits in tone production ability in most prelingually deafened children with CIs, even after prolonged use of the devices. The strong correlation between the two methods suggested that the simpler, 2D method seemed to be efficient in acoustic assessment for lexical tones in hearing-impaired children. Age at implantation and especially the duration of CI use were significant, although weak, predictors for tone development in pediatric CI users. Although a large part of tone production ability could not be attributed to these two factors, the results still encourage early implantation and continual CI use for better lexical tone development in Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI users.												7	8											NOV 4	2020	14								592954	10.3389/fnins.2020.592954	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.592954												2026-01-16	WOS:000590261300001
J	Hsieh, IH; Guo, YJ				Hsieh, I-Hui; Guo, Yu-Jyun			No Musician Advantage in the Perception of Degraded-Fundamental Frequency Speech in Noisy Environments	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Pitch variations of the fundamental frequency (fo) contour contribute to speech perception in noisy environments, but whether musicians confer an advantage in speech in noise (SIN) with altered fo information remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different levels of degraded fo contour (i.e., conveying lexical tone or intonation information) on musician advantage in speech-in-noise perception.Method: A cohort of native Mandarin Chinese speakers, comprising 30 trained musicians and 30 nonmusicians, were tested on the intelligibility of Mandarin Chinese sentences with natural, flattened-tone, flattened-intonation, and flattened-all fo contours embedded in background noise masked under three signal-to-noise ratios (0, -5, and -9 dB). Pitch difference thresholds and innate musical skills associated with speech-in-noise benefits were also assessed.Results: Speech intelligibility score improved with increasing signal-to-noise level for both musicians and nonmusicians. However, no musician advantage was observed for identifying any type of flattened-fo contour SIN. Musicians exhibited smaller fo pitch discrimination limens than nonmusicians, which correlated with benefits for perceiving speech with intact tone-level fo information. Regardless of musician status, performance on the pitch and accent musical skill subtests correlated with speech intelligibility score. Conclusions: Collectively, these results provide no evidence for a musician advantage for perceiving speech with distorted fo information in noisy environments. Results further show that perceptual musical skills on pitch and accent processing may benefit the perception of SIN, independent of formal musical training. Our findings suggest that the potential application of music training in speech perception in noisy backgrounds is not contingent on the ability to process fo pitch contours, at least for Mandarin Chinese speakers.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23706354												1	1											AUG	2023	66	8					2643	2655		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00662												2026-01-16	WOS:001056733600006
J	Winskel, H; Perea, M				Winskel, Heather; Perea, Manuel			Does tonal information affect the early stages of visual-word processing in Thai?	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Thai offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of lexical tone processing during visual-word recognition, as tone is explicitly expressed in its script. In order to investigate the contribution of tone at the orthographic/phonological level during the early stages of word processing in Thai, we conducted a masked priming experimentusing both lexical decision and word naming tasks. For a given target word (e.g., ????/h?:?2/, room), five priming conditions were created: (a) identity (e.g., ????/h?:?2/), (b) same initial consonant, but with a different tone marker (e.g., ????/h?:?1/), (c) different initial consonant, but with the same tone marker (e.g., ????/s?:?2/), (d) orthographic control (different initial consonant, different tone marker; e.g., ????/s?:?1/), and (e) same tone homophony, but with a different initial consonant and different tone marker (e.g., ????/t(h)?:?2/). Results of the critical comparisons revealed that segmental information (i.e., consonantal information) appears to be more important than tone information (i.e., tone marker) in the early stages of visual-word processing in alphabetic, tonal languages like Thai. Thus, these findings may help constrain models of visual-word recognition and reading in tonal languages.												9	12											FEB 1	2014	67	2					209	219		10.1080/17470218.2013.813054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.813054												2026-01-16	WOS:000330104000001
J	Lee, CY				Lee, Chia-Ying			Neural Underpinnings of Early Speech Perception and Emergent Literacy	FOLIA PHONIATRICA ET LOGOPAEDICA				Article								Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential component used to index automatic auditory change detection. Thus, MMN provides an excellent tool to assess the speech sensitivity of infants and children. Although MMN is well established in adults, the polarity and latency of mismatch responses (MMRs) in infants are highly inconsistent across studies. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of MMN studies of speech perception in early infancy. In particular, data from a series of MMN studies of Mandarin lexical tone, vowels, and initial consonants will be presented to demonstrate how phonological saliency, size of deviance, and neural maturation modulate MMRs in early infancy. These data suggest that MMN and positive MMRs index different functional characteristics and may provide information on when and how children's speech perception becomes automatic at different developmental stages. By using MMN to index sensitivity to speech discrimination, dyslexic children usually show reduced or absent MMN, which supports the relationship between phonological sensitivity and literacy. However, children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed the typical MMN, but attenuated P3a and enhanced late discriminative negativity. Taken together, the MMR characteristics, including amplitude, peak latency, and the transition of polarity, may be used to index the maturation of speech development and for the early identification of children with atypical language development.

Effects of native language and training on lexical tone perception: An event-related potential study	BRAIN RESEARCH				Article								Tone languages such as Thai use pitch differences to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have reported that naive listeners can discriminate among lexical tones, but that native language background affects performance. The present study uses ERPs to determine whether native speakers of a tone language (Mandarin Chinese) and of a nontone language (English) differ in their pre-attentive discrimination among Thai lexical tones, and whether training has a different effect in these two language groups. EEGs were obtained from 10 native Mandarin Chinese speakers, 10 English and 10 Thai speakers in an oddball paradigm: The Thai syllable [k(h)a:] pronounced with a high rising or low falling tone, was presented as an infrequent deviant amidst a standard mid level tone [k(h)a] syllable, while participants watched a silent movie. Next, the Chinese and English participants completed a 2-day perceptual identification training on the mid level and low falling tones, and returned for a post training EEG. The low falling tone deviant elicited a Mismatch Negativity (MMN) in all participant groups before and after training; the high rising deviant elicited no, or a smaller, MMN, which became larger after training only in the English group. The high rising deviant also elicited a later negativity (350-650 ms) versus the mid level standard, which decreased after training in the Chinese group. These results suggest that non-Thai speakers can pre-attentively discriminate among Thai tones, but are sensitive to different physical properties of the tones, depending on their native language. English speakers are more sensitive to early pitch differences, whereas native speakers of Mandarin Chinese are more sensitive to the (later) pitch contour. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hallé, PA; Chang, YC; Best, CT				Hallé, PA; Chang, YC; Best, CT			Identification and discrimination of Mandarin Chinese tones by Mandarin Chinese vs. French listeners	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Previous work has not yielded clear conclusions about the categorical nature of perception of tone contrasts by native listeners of tone languages. We reopen this issue in a cross-linguistic study comparing Taiwan Mandarin and French listeners. We tested these listeners on three tone continua derived from natural Mandarin utterances within carrier sentences, created via a state-of-the-art pitch-scaling technique in which within-continuum interpolation was applied to both f(0) and intensity contours. Classic assessments of categorization and discrimination of each tone continuum were conducted with both groups of listeners. In Experiment 1. Taiwanese listeners identified the tone of target syllables within carrier sentence context and discriminated tones of single syllables. In Experiment 2, both French and Taiwanese listeners completed an AXB identification task on single syllables. Finally, French listeners were run on an AXB discrimination task in Experiment 3. Results indicated that Taiwanese listeners' perception of tones is quasi-categorical whereas French listeners' is psych ophysically based. French listeners nevertheless show substantial sensitivity to tone contour differences, though to a lesser extent than Taiwanese listeners. Thus, the findings suggest that despite the lack of lexical tone contrasts in the French language, French listeners are not absolutely "deaf" to tonal variations. They simply fail to perceive tones along the lines of a well-defined and finite set of linguistic categories. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ge, YX; Rato, A; Rebuschat, P; Monaghan, P				Ge, Yuxin; Rato, Anabela; Rebuschat, Patrick; Monaghan, Padraic			Constraints on novel word learning in heritage speakers	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Introduction Recent research on word learning has found that adults can rapidly learn novel words by tracking cross-situational statistics, but learning is greatly influenced by the phonological properties of the words and by the native language of the speakers. Mandarin-native speakers could easily pick up novel words with Mandarin tones after a short exposure, but English-native speakers had specific difficulty with the tonal components. It is, however, unclear how much experience with Mandarin is needed to successfully use the tonal cue in word learning. In this study, we explored this question by focusing on the heritage language population, who typically are exposed to the target language at an early age but then develop and switch to another majority language. Specifically, we investigated whether heritage Mandarin speakers residing in an English-speaking region and speaking English as a dominant language would be able to learn novel Mandarin tonal words from statistical tracking. It helps us understand whether early exposure to the target feature is sufficient to promote the use of that feature in word learning later in life.Methods We trained 30 heritage Mandarin speakers with Mandarin pseudowords via a cross-situational statistical word learning task (CSWL).Results and discussion Heritage Mandarin speakers were able to learn the pseudowords across multiple situations, but similar-sounding words (i.e., minimal pairs) were more difficult to identify, and words that contrast only in lexical tones (i.e., Mandarin lexical tone) were distinguished at chance level throughout learning. We also collected information about the participants' heritage language (HL) experience and usage. We did not observe a relationship between HL experience/usage and performance in tonal word learning, suggesting that HL exposure does not necessarily lead to an advantage in learning the target language.												2	2											APR 17	2024	15								1379736	10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1379736	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1379736												2026-01-16	WOS:001210817800001

Brainstem encoding of speech and musical stimuli in congenital amusia: evidence from Cantonese speakers	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of musical processing that also impacts subtle aspects of speech processing. It remains debated at what stage(s) of auditory processing deficits in amusia arise. In this study, we investigated whether amusia originates from impaired subcortical encoding of speech On quiet and noise) and musical sounds in the brainstem. Fourteen Cantonese-speaking amusics and 14 matched controls passively listened to six Cantonese lexical tones in quiet, two Cantonese tones in noise (signal-to-noise ratios at 0 and 20 dB), and two cello tones in quiet while their frequency-following responses (FFRs) to these tones were recorded. All participants also completed a behavioral lexical tone identification task. The results indicated normal brainstem encoding of pitch in speech On quiet and noise) and musical stimuli in amusics relative to controls, as measured by FFR pitch strength, pitch error, and stimulus-to-response correlation. There was also no group difference in neural conduction time or FFR amplitudes. Both groups demonstrated better FFRs to speech On quiet and noise) than to musical stimuli. However, a significant group difference was observed for tone identification, with amusics showing significantly lower accuracy than controls. Analysis of the tone confusion matrices suggested that amusics were more likely than controls to confuse between tones that shared similar acoustic features. Interestingly, this deficit in lexical tone identification was not coupled with brainstem abnormality for either speech or musical stimuli. Together, our results suggest that the amusic brainstem is not functioning abnormally, although higher-order linguistic pitch processing is impaired in amusia. This finding has significant implications for theories of central auditory processing, requiring further investigations into how different stages of auditory processing interact in the human brain.												50	50											JAN 6	2015	8								1029	10.3389/fnhum.2014.01029	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2014.01029												2026-01-16	WOS:000347516500002

Mandarin has four lexical tones characterized by a high-level tone (T1), high rising tone (T2), low-dipping tone (T3), and high-falling tone (T4), in which the T2/T3 contrast is acoustically less discriminable in developmental groups. Therefore, this study further examined how deficits in children with DLD would vary with tonal contrasts? acoustic saliency. Method: Event-related potentials were measured using the multideviant oddball paradigm described by Lee et al. (2012), who used Mandarin syllables [i] in T3 as the standard sound (80%), T1 as the large deviant (10%), and T2 as the small deviant (10%). Twelve children with DLD aged between 4 and 6 years participated in this study, and 12 age-matched children with typical development were selected from the data set of Lee et al. (2012) as the controls. Results: The T1/T3 change elicited adultlike mismatch negativity in both the DLD and control groups, while no group difference was revealed. The T2/T3 change elicited a robust positive mismatch response (P-MMR) in children with DLD, while the P-MMR was less significant in the control group. The group comparisons revealed a larger P-MMR in children with DLD than in the control group. Furthermore, children with lower scores in language assessments tend to reveal larger P-MMRs. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that deficits in children with DLD in discriminating subtle lexical tone changes reflect greater positivity of P-MMR to T2/T3 change. This implies that MMR to T2/T3 may serve as a neural marker for evaluating language delay in preschoolers.												10	10											APR	2021	64	4					1176	1188		10.1044/2021_JSLHR-19-00392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-19-00392												2026-01-16	WOS:000640606600006
J	Ong, JH; Burnham, D; Escudero, P				Ong, Jia Hoong; Burnham, Denis; Escudero, Paola			Distributional Learning of Lexical Tones: A Comparison of Attended vs. Unattended Listening	PLOS ONE				Article								This study examines whether non-tone language listeners can acquire lexical tone categories distributionally and whether attention in the training phase modulates the effect of distributional learning. Native Australian English listeners were trained on a Thai lexical tone minimal pair and their performance was assessed using a discrimination task before and after training. During Training, participants either heard a Unimodal distribution that would induce a single central category, which should hinder their discrimination of that minimal pair, or a Bimodal distribution that would induce two separate categories that should facilitate their discrimination. The participants either heard the distribution passively (Experiments 1A and 1B) or performed a cover task during training designed to encourage auditory attention to the entire distribution (Experiment 2). In passive listening (Experiments 1A and 1B), results indicated no effect of distributional learning: the Bimodal group did not outperform the Unimodal group in discriminating the Thai tone minimal pairs. Moreover, both Unimodal and Bimodal groups improved above chance on most test aspects from Pretest to Posttest. However, when participants' auditory attention was encouraged using the cover task (Experiment 2), distributional learning was found: the Bimodal group outperformed the Unimodal group on a novel test syllable minimal pair at Posttest relative to at Pretest. Furthermore, the Bimodal group showed above-chance improvement from Pretest to Posttest on three test aspects, while the Unimodal group only showed above-chance improvement on one test aspect. These results suggest that non-tone language listeners are able to learn lexical tones distributionally but only when auditory attention is encouraged in the acquisition phase. This implies that distributional learning of lexical tones is more readily induced when participants attend carefully during training, presumably because they are better able to compute the relevant statistics of the distribution.												27	29											JUL 27	2015	10	7							e0133446	10.1371/journal.pone.0133446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133446												2026-01-16	WOS:000358594300020

While the linguistic and cognitive evidence for lexical tone is therefore beyond dispute, the word prosodic systems of many languages continue to escape the categorizations of typologists. One controversy concerns the existence of a typological class of "pitch accent languages," another the underlying phonological nature of surface tone contrasts, which in some cases have been claimed to be metrical rather than tonal. We address the question whether the Sequence Recall Task (SRT), which has been shown to discriminate between languages with and without word stress, can distinguish languages with and without lexical tone. Using participants from non-tonal Indonesian, semi-tonal Swedish, and two varieties of tonal Mandarin, we ran SRTs with monosyllabic tonal contrasts to test the hypothesis that high performance in a tonal SRT indicates the lexical status of tone. An additional question concerned the extent to which accuracy scores depended on phonological and phonetic properties of a language's tone system, like its complexity, the existence of an experimental contrast in a language's phonology, and the phonetic salience of a contrast. The results suggest that a tonal SRT is not likely to discriminate between tonal and non-tonal languages within a typologically varied group, because of the effects of specific properties of their tone systems. Future research should therefore address the first hypothesis with participants from otherwise similar tonal and non-tonal varieties of the same language, where results from a tonal SRT may make a useful contribution to the typological debate on word prosody.												3	3											JUL 12	2022	13								902569	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.902569	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.902569												2026-01-16	WOS:000832794600001

The underlying neural mechanism of such association may lie in the brain processing of phonological information. Lower amplitude of auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been associated with poor phonological awareness and with the presence of reading disability. The current study recorded auditory MMN to phoneme and lexical tone contrast with odd-ball paradigm and examined whether auditory MMN mediated the associations between phonological awareness and character reading ability through a three-year longitudinal study in 78 native Mandarin-speaking kindergarten children. Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses showed that the effect of phoneme awareness on the character reading ability was mediated by the phonemic MMN in young Chinese children. Findings underscore the key role of phonemic MMN as the underlying neurodevelopmental mechanism linking phoneme awareness and reading ability.												2	2											SEP 9	2023	188								108624	10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108624		JUN 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001060254600001

We tested 2- to 6-month-old Mandarin learners to explore age-related improvements in tone discrimination, the role of inferior frontal regions in abstract speech category representation, and left hemisphere lateralization during tone processing. Using a block design, we presented four Mandarin tones via [ta] and measured oxygenated hemoglobin concentration with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results showed age-related improvements in tone discrimination, greater involvement of frontal regions in older infants indicating abstract tonal representation development and increased bilateral activation mirroring native adult Mandarin speakers. These findings contribute to our broader understanding of the relationship between native speech acquisition and infant brain development during the critical period of early language learning.												2	2											APR 1	2024	34	4							bhae124	10.1093/cercor/bhae124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhae124												2026-01-16	WOS:001195912800005

Two four-word sequences (prime and target) were presented to French musicians and nonmusicians unfamiliar with Mandarin, and event-related brain potentials were recorded. Musicians detected both tonal and segmental variations more accurately than nonmusicians. Moreover, tonal variations were associated with higher error rate than segmental variations and elicited an increased N2/N3 component that developed 100 msec earlier in musicians than in nonmusicians. Finally, musicians also showed enhanced P3b components to both tonal and segmental variations. These results clearly show that musical expertise influenced the perceptual processing as well as the categorization of linguistic contrasts in a foreign language. They show positive music-to-language transfer effects and open new perspectives for the learning of tone languages.												123	145											OCT	2011	23	10					2701	2715		10.1162/jocn.2010.21585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2010.21585												2026-01-16	WOS:000294055600008

Three factors were manipulated systematically in the study. First, the processing of level tones was compared with that of contour tones. Second, the influence of a linguistic context in tonal processing was studied by contrasting the patterns of brain lateralization for real syllables, pseudo-syllables, and hums. Finally, the discrimination and the identification tasks were used to test how processing depth might modulate the results obtained. A right hemisphere advantage (RHA) was obtained regardless of tone type, stimulus type, and task. In addition, the performance on level tones was in general better than that on contour tones. These findings suggest that Cantonese speakers are highly sensitive to the acoustic features of lexical tones, which supports the acoustic view about tonal processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Zhang, J; Lai, YW				Zhang, Jie; Lai, Yuwen			Testing the role of phonetic knowledge in Mandarin tone sandhi	PHONOLOGY				Article								Phonological patterns often have phonetic bases. But whether phonetic substance should be encoded in synchronic phonological grammar is controversial. We aim to test the synchronic relevance of phonetics by investigating native Mandarin speakers' applications of two exceptionless tone sandhi processes to novel words: the contour reduction 213 -> 21/_T (T not equal 213), which has a clear phonetic motivation, and the perceptually neutralising 213 -> 35/_213, whose phonetic motivation is less clear. In two experiments, Mandarin subjects were asked to produce two individual monosyllables together as two different types of novel disyllabic words. Results show that speakers apply the 213 -> 21 sandhi with greater accuracy than the 213 -> 35 sandhi in novel words, indicating a synchronic bias against the phonetically less motivated pattern. We also show that lexical frequency is relevant to the application of the sandhis to novel words, but cannot account alone for the low sandhi accuracy of 213 -> 35.												85	111												2010	27	1					153	201		10.1017/S0952675710000060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952675710000060												2026-01-16	WOS:000277884300005
J	Hirata-Edds, T; Herrick, D				Hirata-Edds, Tracy; Herrick, Dylan			Building Tone Resources for Second Language Learners from Phonetic Documentation: Cherokee Examples	LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION & CONSERVATION				Article								Lexical tone is a linguistic feature which can present difficulties for second language learners wanting to revitalize their heritage language. This is true not only from the standpoint of understanding and pronunciation, but also because tone is often under-documented and resources are limited or too technical to be useful to community members. Even with these challenges, carefully attending to the intricacies of a language's sound system allows learners to express themselves more "authentically" or "naturally," which can be important for confidence and acceptance as language users. Learners can be trained to distinguish tones by attending to acoustic or auditory cues related to tone (e.g., pitch contour). This paper describes multimedia resources designed to focus learner attention on perceiving tone - visual and audio accompaniments helping to increase the perception of tone in Cherokee, a severely endangered Native American language. We created resources for tone in the form of an electronic presentation containing explanations, example recordings, and intuitive images to provide audio and visual support for language learners. Presentation and format choices were collaboratively designed based on community requests, with an explicit attempt to de-jargonize materials and make them less technical and more accessible to community members.												2	3												2017	11						289	304															2026-01-16	WOS:000498633200002

Effect of Linguistic and Musical Experience on Distributional Learning of Nonnative Lexical Tones	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Evidence suggests that extensive experience with lexical tones or musical training provides an advantage in perceiving nonnative lexical tones. This investigation concerns whether such an advantage is evident in learning nonnative lexical tones based on the distributional structure of the input. Method: Using an established protocol, distributional learning of lexical tones was investigated with tone language (Mandarin) listeners with no musical training (Experiment 1) and nontone language (Australian English) listeners with musical training (Experiment 2). Within each experiment, participants were trained on a bimodal (2-peak) or a unimodal (single peak) distribution along a continuum spanning a Thai lexical tone minimal pair. Discrimination performance on the target minimal pair was assessed before and after training. Results: Mandarin nonmusicians exhibited clear distributional learning (listeners in the bimodal, but not those in the unimodal condition, improved significantly as a function of training), whereas Australian English musicians did not (listeners in both the bimodal and unimodal conditions improved as a function of training). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that veridical perception of lexical tones is not sufficient for distributional learning of nonnative lexical tones to occur. Rather, distributional learning appears to be modulated by domain-specific pitch experience and is constrained possibly by top-down interference.												17	18											OCT	2017	60	10					2769	2780		10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2016_JSLHR-S-16-0080												2026-01-16	WOS:000417821500001
J	Chang, CHC; Lin, TH; Kuo, WJ				Chang, Claire H. C.; Lin, Tzu-Hui; Kuo, Wen-Jui			Does phonological rule of tone substitution modulate mismatch negativity?	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS				Article								This study examined whether the phonological substitution rule of tone sandhi modulates tone perception in the preattentive stage. Tone sandhi is commonly present in East Asian languages. An example from Mandarin is the Tone tone 3 sandhi rule: T3 is pronounced as T2 when followed by another T3 (33 -> 23). Previous mismatch negativity (MMN) studies in Mandarin have reported a smaller amplitude or longer latency in standard-deviant pair consisting of T2 and T3 (T2-T3) than in Tl-T3. The most widely accepted explanation for this is that T2 and T3 have steeper pitch slopes than Tl. This study tested an alternative account based on the phonological rule that the frequent substitution that occurs between T2 and T3 results in reduced MMN. In Experiment 1, we first tried to replicate the finding in Mandarin. In Experiment 2, using both unskilled and skilled speakers, we tested a sandhi tone pair of very different pitch slopes in Taiwanese. Delayed peak latency of sandhi pair was evident in both languages but only in skilled speakers. Our results did not support the shared-pitch-slope account and were instead consistent with the argument that a language-specific phonological rule could modulate preattentive tone processing.												5	6											AUG	2019	51						63	75		10.1016/j.jneuroling.2019.01.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroling.2019.01.001												2026-01-16	WOS:000471210700005
J	Lee-Kim, SI				Lee-Kim, Sang-Im			Stop Laryngeal Distinctions Driven by Contrastive Effects of Neighboring Tones	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study examined contrastive effects of neighboring tones that give rise to a systematic asymmetry in stop perception. Korean-speaking learners of Mandarin Chinese and naive listeners labeled voiceless unaspirated stops preceded or followed by low or high extrinsic tonal context (e.g., ma(LO).pa vs. ma(HI).pa) either as lenis (associated with a low F0 at the vowel onset) or as fortis stops (with a high F0). Further, the target tone itself varied between level and rising (e.g., ma(LO).pa(LEV) vs. ma(LO).pa(RIS)). Both groups of listeners showed significant contrastive effects of extrinsic context. Specifically, more lenis responses were elicited in a high tone context than in a low one, and vice versa. This indicates that the onset F0 of a stop is perceived lower in a high tone context, which, in turn, provides positive evidence for lenis stops. This effect was more clearly pronounced for the level than for the contour tone target and also for the preceding than for the following context irrespective of linguistic experience. Despite qualitative similarities, learners showed larger effects for all F0 variables, indicating that the degree of context effects may be enhanced by one's phonetic knowledge, namely sensitivity to F0 cues along with the processing of consecutive tones acquired through learning a tone language.												1	1											MAR	2021	64	1					98	122	0023830920922897	10.1177/0023830920922897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830920922897		JUN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000537165000001

Here we examine the mismatch negativity (MMN) response to the contrast between Mandarin Tone 3 (T3) and other tones using a passive oddball paradigm. Because the MMN response has been shown to be sensitive to the featural contents of speech sounds in a way that is compatible with underspecification theories of phonological representations, here, we test the predictions of such theories regarding suprasegmental phenomena. Assuming T3 to be underspecified in Mandarin (because it has variable surface representations and low pitch), we predicted that an asymmetric MMN response would be elicited when T3 is contrasted with another tone. In 2 of our 3 experiments, this was observed, but in non-Mandarin-speaking participants as well as native speakers, suggesting that the locus of the effect was perceptual (acoustic or phonetic) rather than phonological. In a third experiment, the predicted asymmetry was limited to native speakers. These results highlight the importance of distinguishing phonological and perceptual contributions to MMN asymmetries, but also demonstrate a role of abstract phonological representations in which certain information is underspecified in long-term memory.												35	38											OCT	2016	42	10					1547	1570		10.1037/xhp0000242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xhp0000242												2026-01-16	WOS:000384646300007

Intonation Contrast in Cantonese Speakers With Hypokinetic Dysarthria Associated With Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Speech produced by individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a number of features including impaired speech prosody. The purpose of this study was to investigate intonation contrasts produced by this group of speakers. Method: Speech materials with a question-statement contrast were collected from 14 Cantonese speakers with PD. Twenty listeners then classified the productions as either questions or statements. Acoustic analyses of F0, duration, and intensity were conducted to determine which acoustic cues distinguished the production of questions from statements, and which cues appeared to be exploited by listeners in identifying intonational contrasts. Results: The results show that listeners identified statements with a high degree of accuracy, but the accuracy of question identification ranged from 0.56% to 96% across the 14 speakers. The speakers with PD used similar acoustic cues as nondysarthric Cantonese speakers to mark the question-statement contrast, although the contrasts were not observed in all speakers. Listeners mainly used F0 cues at the final syllable for intonation identification. Conclusion: These data contribute to the researchers' understanding of intonation marking in speakers with PD, with specific application to the production and perception of intonation in a lexical tone language.												27	36											AUG 1	2010	53	4					836	849		10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0216)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0216)												2026-01-16	WOS:000280598100003
J	Ou, SC				Ou, Shu-Chen			Taiwanese EFL Learners' Perception of English Word Stress	CONCENTRIC-STUDIES IN LINGUISTICS				Article								This paper investigates how Taiwanese EFL learners perceive non-word pairs which differ only in the location of stress (e.g., fercept vs. fercept) when the phonetic cue of pitch is manipulated. Fifty-eight Taiwanese EFL learners participated in two forced choice perceptual experiments, in which they were asked to identify a perceived non-word when its stressed syllable was signified either (i) by higher pitch or (ii) by a low rising tonal contour. The results show that, while these L2 learners had little difficulty in perceiving stress when the stress was signified by higher pitch, they all had great difficulty in doing so when the stress was signified by the low rising tonal contour. In addition, analyses of their errors show that less experienced learners relied mainly on higher pitch or rising pitch contour in guessing the position of stress, which may indicate a persistent effect of their L1 tonal system or L2 learners' universal tendency of perceiving stress, while more experienced learners referred to the information of morpho-syntactic categories as a strategy in guessing the position of stress, suggesting their phonological awareness of the difference between lexical tone and lexical stress at their developmental stage.												15	22											JAN	2010	36	1					1	23															2026-01-16	WOS:000219938300001

Elucidating the influences of embodiment and conceptual metaphor on lexical and non-speech tone learning	COGNITION				Article								In the contexts of language learning and music processing, hand gestures conveying acoustic information visually influence perception of speech and non-speech sounds (Connell et al., 2013; Morett & Chang, 2015). Currently, it is unclear whether this effect is due to these gestures' use of the human body to highlight relevant features of language (embodiment) or the cross-modal mapping between the visual motion trajectories of these gestures and corresponding auditory features (conceptual metaphor). To address this question, we examined identification of the pitch contours of lexical tones and non-speech analogs learned with pitch gesture, comparable dot motion, or no motion. Critically, pitch gesture and dot motion were either congruent or incongruent with the vertical conceptual metaphor of pitch. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that identification accuracy increased for tones learned with congruent pitch gesture and dot motion, whereas it remained stable or decreased for tones learned with incongruent pitch gesture and dot motion. These findings provide the first evidence that both embodied and non-embodied visual stimuli congruent with the vertical conceptual metaphor of pitch enhance lexical and non-speech tone learning. Thus, they illuminate the influences of conceptual metaphor and embodiment on lexical and non-speech auditory perception, providing insight into how they can be leveraged to enhance language learning and music processing.												16	16											MAY	2022	222								105014	10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105014		JAN 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000745686700012

While these interactions are established for semantic and syntactic processes, the functional network of speech intonation - the linguistic variation of pitch - has been scarcely defined. Particularly little is known about intonation in tonal languages, in which pitch not only serves intonation but also expresses meaning via lexical tones. The present study used psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterise the neural networks underlying intonation and tone processing in native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Participants categorised either intonation or tone of monosyllabic Mandarin words that gradually varied between statement and question and between Tone 2 and Tone 4. Intonation processing induced bilateral fronto-temporal activity and increased functional connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal regions, likely linking auditory perception and labelling of intonation categories in a phonological network. Tone processing induced bilateral temporal activity, associated with the auditory representation of tonal (phonemic) categories. Together, the present data demonstrate the breadth of the functional intonation network in a tonal language including higher-level phonological processes in addition to auditory representations common to both intonation and tone.												10	11											JAN	2021	42	1					161	174		10.1002/hbm.25214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25214		SEP 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000573645300001

This study reports on the implementation of one such strategy (fine structure processing, FSP) in children. Methods: This was a prospective study investigating the upgrade tc a new speech processor. The upgrade used a repeated measures design with an alternating order of conditions (A-B-A-B design). Twelve pre- and perilingually deaf children with MED-EL C40+ cochlear implants were enrolled in the study. Patients were upgraded from their Tempo+ speech processor, which used continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) in combination with a frequency spectrum of 200-8500 Hz, to an Opus speech processor, which used FSP with an extended frequency spectrum of 70-8500 Hz. The primary means of testing was an HSM (Hochmair, Schulz and Moser) sentence test at 65 and 80 dB in quiet. In addition, the "Mainzer Kindersprachtest" (Mainz audiometric speech test for children) was applied at 65 and 70 dB. Results: When the new FSP speech processor was used together with the extended low frequency range, HSM sentence tests at 65 and 80 dB resulted in scores indicating statisticially significant improvements of 7.1 and 9.9 percentage points, respectively. Scores in the "Mainzer Kindersprachtest" at 65 and 70 dB indicated statistically significant improvements of 9.3 and 6.1 percentage points, respectively. Conclusions: The present study clearly shows that children benefit from the fine structure speech coding strategy in combination with an extended frequency spectrum in tire low frequencies, as is offered by the Opus speech processors. This should be taken into consideration when fitting pre- and perilingually deaf children implanted almost a decade previously. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Lu, YA; Lee-Kim, SI				Lu, Yu-An; Lee-Kim, Sang-Im			The effect of linguistic experience on perceived vowel duration: Evidence from Taiwan Mandarin speakers	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								Perceived vowel duration is known to be influenced by many factors, including f0 height/movement and ones' native phonological system. Using multiple experimental paradigms, this study examined whether native tonal representations and phonetic knowledge of duration associated with different lexical tones may further shape the ways in which vowel duration is perceived. In a perception experiment, Taiwan Mandarin and Korean listeners rated the duration of duration-controlled CV syllables carrying one of the four lexical tones in Mandarin or a reduced T3half (X-21). The results showed that perceived vowel duration by Korean listeners, the control group, reflected general perceptual biases: contour tones were rated as longer than level tones, and high-f0 tones were rated as longer than low-f0 tones. Taiwan Mandarin listeners, on the other hand, overestimated the duration of vowels carrying T3 (X-214) and T3half, despite their short phonetic duration in Taiwan Mandarin, indicating the significance of the canonical representation of the complex T3 contour. A spontaneous imitation experiment further supported the canonicity effect: T3half was again hyperarticulated, produced as longer and with similar f0 trajectories as T3full, based on its phonological association to T3. Taken together, the findings of the present study suggest that the perception of vowel duration is guided by higher-order phonological knowledge from speakers' linguistic experience as well as by general perceptual biases.

J	Wong, PS; Leung, CTT				Wong, Puisan; Leung, Carrie Tsz-Tin			Suprasegmental Features Are Not Acquired Early: Perception and Production of Monosyllabic Cantonese Lexical Tones in 4-to 6-Year-Old Preschool Children	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Previous studies reported that children acquire Cantonese tones before 3 years of age, supporting the assumption in models of phonological development that suprasegmental features are acquired rapidly and early in children. Yet, recent research found a large disparity in the age of Cantonese tone acquisition. This study investigated Cantonese tone development in 4- to 6-year-old children. Method: Forty-eight 4- to 6-year-old Cantonese-speaking children and 28 mothers of the children labeled 30 pictures representing familiar words in the 6 tones in a picture-naming task and identified pictures representing words in different Cantonese tones in a picture-pointing task. To control for lexical biases in tone assessment, tone productions were low-pass filtered to eliminate lexical information. Five judges categorized the tones in filtered stimuli. Tone production accuracy, tone perception accuracy, and correlation between tone production and perception accuracy were examined. Results: Children did not start to produce adultlike tones until 5 and 6 years of age. Four-year-olds produced none of the tones with adultlike accuracy. Five-and 6-year-olds attained adultlike productions in 2 (T5 and T6) to 3 (T4, T5, and T6) tones, respectively. Children made better progress in tone perception and achieved higher accuracy in perception than in production. However, children in all age groups perceived none of the tones as accurately as adults, except that T1 was perceived with adultlike accuracy by 6-year-olds. Only weak association was found between children's tone perception and production accuracy. Conclusions: Contradicting to the long-held assumption that children acquire lexical tone rapidly and early before the mastery of segmentals, this study found that 4- to 6-yearold children have not mastered the perception or production of the full set of Cantonese tones in familiar monosyllabic words. Larger development was found in children's tone perception than tone production. The higher tone perception accuracy but weak correlation between tone perception and production abilities in children suggested that tone perception accuracy is not sufficient for children's tone production accuracy. The findings have clinical and theoretical implications.												21	23											MAY	2018	61	5					1070	1085		10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0288												2026-01-16	WOS:000432882300002
J	Hsieh, L; Gandour, J; Wong, D; Hutchins, GD				Hsieh, L; Gandour, J; Wong, D; Hutchins, GD			Functional heterogeneity of inferior frontal gyrus is shaped by linguistic experience	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive-Neuroscience-Society	APR, 2000	SAN FRANCISCO, CA					A crosslinguistic, positron emission tomography (PET) study was conducted to determine the influence of linguistic experience on the perception of segmental (consonants and vowels) and suprasegmental (tones) information. Chinese and English subjects (10 per group) were presented binaurally with lists consisting of five Chinese monosyllabic morphemes (speech) or low-pass-filtered versions of the same stimuli (nonspeech). The first and last items were targeted for comparison: the time interval between target tones was filled with irrelevant dis tractor tones. A speeded-response, selective attention paradigm required subjects to make discrimination judgments of the target items while ignoring intervening distractor tones. PET scans were acquired for five tasks presented twice: one passive listening to pitch (nonspeech) and four active (speech = consonant. von el, and tone; nonspeech = pitch). Significant regional changes in blood Row were identified from comparisons of group-averaged images of active tasks relative to passive listening. Chinese subjects show increased activity in left premotor cortex, pars opercularis, and pars triangularis across the four tasks. English subjects, on the other hand, show increased activity in left inferior frontal gyrus regions only in the vowel task and in right inferior frontal gyrus regions in the pitch task. Findings suggest that functional circuits engaged in speech perception depend on Linguistic experience. All linguistic information signaled by prosodic cues engages left-hemisphere mechanisms. Storage and executive processes of workings memory that are implicated in phonological processing are mediated in discrete regions of the left frontal lobe.

Perceptual assimilation of lexical tone: The roles of language experience and visual information	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								Using Best's (1995) perceptual assimilation model (PAM), we investigated auditory-visual (AV), auditory-only (AO), and visual-only (VO) perception of Thai tones. Mandarin and Cantonese (tone-language) speakers were asked to categorize Thai tones according to their own native tone categories, and Australian English (non-tone-language) speakers to categorize Thai tones into their native intonation categories-for instance, question or statement. As comparisons, Thai participants completed a straightforward identification task, and another Australian English group identified the Thai tones using simple symbols. All of the groups also completed an AX discrimination task. Both the Mandarin and Cantonese groups categorized AO and AV Thai falling tones as their native level tones, and Thai rising tones as their native rising tones, although the Mandarin participants found it easier to categorize Thai level tones than did the Cantonese participants. VO information led to very poor categorization for all groups, and AO and AV information also led to very poor categorizations for the English intonation categorization group. PAM's predictions regarding tone discriminability based on these category assimilation patterns were borne out for the Mandarin group's AO and AV discriminations, providing support for the applicability of the PAM to lexical tones. For the Cantonese group, however, PAM was unable to account for one specific discrimination pattern-namely, their relatively good performance on the Thai high-rising contrast in the auditory conditions-and no predictions could be derived for the English groups. A full account of tone assimilation will likely need to incorporate considerations of phonetic, and even acoustic, similarity and overlap between nonnative and native tone categories.												47	52											FEB	2015	77	2					571	591		10.3758/s13414-014-0791-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-014-0791-3												2026-01-16	WOS:000350102800016

This study was designed to address this issue with behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Method: Behavioral identification and auditory event-related potential (ERP) components for speech discrimination, including mismatch negativity (MMN), N2b, and P3b, were measured in 23 native Korean speakers who were highly proficient late L2 learners of Chinese. For the ERP measures, both passive and active listening tasks were administered to examine the automatic and attentioncontrolled discriminative responses to within- and across-category differences for carefully chosen stimuli from a lexical tone continuum. Results: The behavioral task revealed native-like identification function of the tonal continuum. Correspondingly, the active oddball task demonstrated larger P3b amplitudes for the across-category than within-category deviants in the left recording site, indicating clear CP of lexical tones in the attentive condition. By contrast, similar MMN responses in the right recording site were elicited by both the across- and within-category deviants, indicating the absence of CP effect with automatic phonological processing of lexical tones at the pre-attentive stage even in L2 learners with high Chinese proficiency. Conclusion: Although behavioral data showed clear evidence of categorical perception of lexical tones in proficient L2 learners, ERP measures from passive and active listening tasks demonstrated fine-grained sensitivity in terms of response polarity, latency, and laterality in revealing different aspects of auditory versus linguistic processing associated with speech decoding by means of largely implicit native language acquisition versus effortful explicit L2 learning.												5	7											DEC	2021	64	12					4695	4704		10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00210												2026-01-16	WOS:000756142500010
J	Zhang, F; Wei, XH; Jiang, XY; Chen, L; Wang, HF; Lei, JH				Zhang, Fen; Wei, Xuehan; Jiang, Xiangyu; Chen, Liang; Wang, Haifen; Lei, Jianghua			Speechreading Ability Affects Mandarin Tone Perception in Young Adults With Prelingual Hearing Impairment in China	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: This cross-sectional study explored how the speechreading ability of adults with hearing impairment (HI) in China would affect their perception of the four Mandarin Chinese lexical tones: high (Tone 1), rising (Tone 2), falling-rising (Tone 3), and falling (Tone 4). We predicted that higher speechreading ability would result in better tone performance and that accuracy would vary among individual tones. Method: A total of 136 young adults with HI (ages 18-25 years) in China participated in the study and completed Chinese speechreading and tone awareness tests. The participants were divided into three groups on their basis of their speechreading performance (HIGH, MIDDLE, and LOW speechreading ability), and their ability to recognize the four Mandarin tones was compared. Results: HI adults with high speechreading ability identified tones more accurately than HI adults with low speechreading ability. The overall performance for Tone 2 was the lowest across all the groups. We found a significant interaction between speechreading ability groups and tone levels; the high speechreading ability group performed significantly better than the low ability group when identifying Tones 1 and 4, and performance on Tone 3 also differed by speechreading ability. Conclusions: These results suggest that speechreading ability affects Mandarin tone perception in adults with HI in China. Higher speechreading ability was associated with better overall tone perception. Tone 2 was the most difficult tone to identify, while identification of the other three lexical tones depended on speechreading ability. In visual language processing, adults with HI must reconstitute phonological units from visual and auditory fragments. To determine the generalizability of these results, they should be examined in languages beyond Mandarin Chinese.

J	Kan, RTY; Schmid, MS				Kan, Rachel T. Y.; Schmid, Monika S.			Development of tonal discrimination in young heritage speakers of Cantonese	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This study uses the Perceptual Assimilation Model for Suprasegmentals (PAM-S) (So & Best, 2008, 2010), supported by the assumptions of the L2 Intonation Learning theory (LILt, Mennen, 2015), to investigate how young heritage speakers of Cantonese living in the United States acquired Cantonese tones. Sixty-seven heritage speakers, aged 5-11, were tested on their perception of Cantonese tonal contrasts using an ABX discrimination task. They were compared to 64 peers aged 5-12 in Hong Kong, where Cantonese is spoken as the majority language but English is also acquired from a young age. Two pairs of tones were tested: Tones 2 (mid rising) and 5 (low rising), which have similar pitch heights and contours, and Tones 1 (high level) and 4 (low falling), which have a larger phonetic contrast. As predicted, the heritage speakers were more accurate in discriminating between the more distinct pair of tones than between the more similar pair. They also scored lower than their peers from Hong Kong in both contrast conditions. Age of testing predicted accuracy for both groups, and Chinese literacy also had a significant effect for the heritage speakers. The potential lack of the Tone 2-5 contrast in the heritage speakers' input is discussed as an explanation for these findings. This study illustrates the divergence in heritage speakers' phonological development compared to majority language speakers, and shows the relevance of the PAM-S and LILt to the heritage language context.

J	Tang, P; Yuen, I; Rattanasone, NX; Gao, LQ; Demuth, K				Tang, Ping; Yuen, Ivan; Xu Rattanasone, Nan; Gao, Liqun; Demuth, Katherine			Longer Cochlear Implant Experience Leads to Better Production of Mandarin Tones for Early Implanted Children	EAR AND HEARING				Article								Objectives: Children with cochlear implants (CIs) face challenges in acquiring tones, since CIs do not transmit pitch information effectively. It has been suggested that longer CI experience provides additional benefits for children implanted early, enabling them to achieve language abilities similar to that of normal-hearing (NH) children (Colletti 2009). Mandarin is a tonal language with four lexical tones and a neutral tone (T0), characterized by distinct pitch and durational patterns. It has been suggested that early implantation (i.e., before 2 years) greatly benefits the acquisition of Mandarin tones by children with CIs (Tang et al. 2019c). In this study, we extend those findings to investigate the effect of CI experience on the acquisition of Mandarin tones for children implanted early. We asked the extent to which they were able to produce distinct pitch and durational patterns of both lexical tones and T0 as a function of CI experience, and the extent to which their tonal productions were acoustically like that of NH children. Design: Forty-four NH 3-year olds and 28 children implanted with CIs between 1 and 2 years, aged 3 to 7, were recruited. The children with CIs were grouped according to the length of CI experience: 3 to 6 years, 2 to 3 years, and 1 to 2 years. Lexical tone and T0 productions were elicited using a picture-naming task. Tonal productions from the children with CIs were acoustically analyzed and compared with those from the NH children. Results: Children with 3 to 6 years of CI experience were able to produce distinct pitch and durational patterns for both lexical tones and T0, with NH-like acoustic realizations. Children with 2 to 3 years of CI experience were also able to produce the expected tonal patterns, although their productions were not yet NH-like. Those with only 1 to 2 years of CI experience, however, were not yet able to produce the distinct acoustic patterns for either lexical tones or T0. Conclusions: These results provide acoustic evidence demonstrating that, when Mandarin-speaking children are implanted before the age of 2, only those with 3 to 6 years of experience were able to produce NH-like tones, including both lexical tone and T0. Children with shorter CI experience (less than 3 years) were unable to produce distinct acoustic patterns for the different tones. This suggests that at least 3 years of CI experience is still needed for early implanted children to acquire tonal distinctions similar to those of NH 3-year olds.												15	15											SEP-OCT	2021	42	5					1405	1411		10.1097/AUD.0000000000001036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000001036												2026-01-16	WOS:000688214600030
J	Chen, YC; Tsao, FM; Liu, HM				Chen, Yuchun; Tsao, Feng-Ming; Liu, Huei-Mei			Developmental changes in brain response to speech perception in late-talking children: A longitudinal MMR study	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE				Article								This study used a longitudinal design to examine the development of mismatch responses (MMRs) to Mandarin lexical tones, an index of neural speech discriminative responses, in late talkers and typical controls at 3, 5, and 6 years of age. Lexical tones are phonetic suprasegments that distinguish the lexical meanings of syllables in tonal languages. The 2 year-old late talkers were later divided into persistent language delay and late bloomer groups according to their performance on standardized language tests at 4 years. Results showed that children with persistent language delay demonstrated more positive mismatch responses than the typical controls at 3 years of age. At the age of 5, no group difference were found in the amplitude of MMRs, but the maturation of MMRs could be observed in the change of topography, with more prominent negative response in the frontal sites only in the typical group. Correlations were found between the index of MMRs at 3 years and children's language performance outcome at 6 years. Our results indicate that the development of fine-grained tone representations is delayed in late-talking children between 3 and 5 years and may be one of the underlying mechanisms which associated with later language performance.

ORL-JOURNAL FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY AND ITS RELATED SPECIALTIES				Article								Background: Cochlear implants are a standard treatment option for the profoundly deaf, but have only recently become a treatment option in China. Chinese is a tonal language, and a change in the lexical tone almost always changes the meaning of a word. Methods: A critical review of the strategies for improving the outcome of cochlear implantation in Chinese speakers was made. Results: The introduction of cochlear implantation in China has stimulated the development of new speech perception tests, which are specific to Chinese, for adults and children. Research undertaken over the last decade in Hong Kong has demonstrated the successful acquisition of tones in adults and children who have received cochlear implants. Surgical approaches have been developed to address specific issues, including post-irradiation and infected ears. New areas of research into the enhancement of speech understanding through signal processing have been established. Conclusions: The findings in these new areas will form the basis of a cochlear implant system for Chinese people in the near future. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

J	Ning, LH				Ning, Li-Hsin			Pitch-shift responses as an online monitoring mechanism during level tone production	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This paper investigates whether pitch-shift responses can be modulated as a function of level tone height in Taiwanese Southern Min (TSM). Twenty-six native TSM speakers were recruited and asked to produce three TSM words that differed in tone on the first syllable but had the same mid-level tone on the second syllable (hence, HM, MM, and LM). The pitch-shift stimuli appeared at 100 ms after vocalization onset and lasted for 200 ms. The magnitudes of the pitch-shift stimuli were +/- 250 cents for HM, +250/-150 cents for MM, and +/- 150 cents for LM, in order to overlap the shifted pitch with another lexical tone. The results show that larger pitch-shift peak amplitudes were elicited when the H level tone of the HM word was downshifted 250 cents to the M level and when the L level tone of the LM word was upshifted 150 cents to the M level tone. However, no significant direction effect was found for the MM word. The M level tone might be perceived non-categorically by native TSM speakers. Overall, the findings suggest that the magnitudes of pitch-shift responses may have to do with the degree of categorical perception.

Assessment of music experience after cochlear implantation: A review of current tools and their utilization	WORLD JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY				Review								Objective: To provide an overview of the current available music assessment tools after cochlear implantation (CI); to report on the utilization of music assessments in the literature; to propose potential future directions in music assessment after CI. Methods: A thorough search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library through October 31, 2020. MeSH search terms, keywords, and phrases included "cochlear implant," "cochlear prosthesis," "auditory prosthesis," "music," "music assessment," "music questionnaire," "music perception," "music enjoyment, and "music experience." Potentially relevant studies were reviewed for inclusion, with particular focus on assessments developed specifically for the cochlear implant population and intended for widespread use. Results/conclusions: Six hundred and forty-three studies were screened for relevance to assessment of music experience among cochlear implantees. Eighty-one studies ultimately met criteria for inclusion. There are multiple validated tools for assessment of music experience after cochlear implantation, each of which provide slightly differing insights into the patients' subjective and/or objective post-activation experience. However, no single assessment tool has been adopted into widespread use and thus, much of the literature pertaining to this topic evaluates outcomes non-uniformly, including single-use assessments designed specifically for the study at hand. The lack of a widely accepted universal tool for assessment of music limits our collective understanding the contributory and mitigating factors applicable to current music experience of cochlear implantees, and limits our ability to uniformly evaluate the success of new implant technologies or music training paradigms.

J	Zhang, KL; Wang, X; Peng, G				Zhang, Kaile; Wang, Xiao; Peng, Gang			Normalization of lexical tones and nonlinguistic pitch contours: Implications for speech-specific processing mechanism	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Context is indispensable for accurate tone perception, especially when the target tone system is as complex as that of Cantonese. However, not all contexts are equally beneficial. Speech contexts are usually more effective in improving lexical tone identification than nonspeech contexts matched in pitch information. Some potential factors which may contribute to these unequal effects have been proposed but, thus far, their plausibility remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, the present study compares the perception of lexical tones and their nonlinguistic counterparts under specific contextual (speech, nonspeech) and attentional (with/without focal attention) conditions. The results reveal a prominent congruency effect-target sounds tend to be identified more accurately when embedded in contexts of the same nature (speech/nonspeech). This finding suggests that speech and nonspeech sounds are partly processed by domain-specific mechanisms and that information from the same domain can be integrated more effectively than that from different domains. Therefore, domain-specific processing of speech could be the most likely cause of the unequal context effect. Moreover, focal attention is not a prerequisite for extracting contextual cues from speech and nonspeech during perceptual normalization. This finding implies that context encoding is highly automatic for native listeners.

Individual variability in cue-weighting and lexical tone learning	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Speech sound patterns can be discerned using multiple acoustic cues. The relative weighting of these cues is known to be language-specific. Speech-sound training in adults induces changes in cue-weighting such that relevant acoustic cues are emphasized. In the current study, the extent to which individual variability in cue weighting contributes to differential success in learning to use foreign sound patterns was examined. Sixteen English-speaking adult participants underwent a sound-to-meaning training paradigm, during which they learned to incorporate Mandarin linguistic pitch contours into words. In addition to cognitive tests, measures of pitch pattern discrimination and identification were collected from all participants. Reaction time data from the discrimination task was subjected to 3-way multidimensional scaling to extract dimensions underlying tone perception. Two dimensions relating to pitch height and pitch direction were found to underlie non-native tone space. Good learners attended more to pitch direction relative to poor learners, before and after training. Training increased the ability to identify and label pitch direction. The results demonstrate that variability in the ability to successfully learn to use pitch in lexical contexts can be explained by pre-training differences in cue-weighting.

Subjects produced high level (T1), mid rising (T2), low dipping (T3), and high falling (T4) tones in conditions with (a) no perturbation, (b) T1 shifted down, (c) T1 shifted down and T3 shifted up, or (d) T1 shifted down and T3 shifted up but without producing other tones. Speakers and new subjects also completed a tone identification task with unaltered and F0-perturbed productions. With only T1 perturbed down, speakers adapted by raising F0 relative to no-perturbation. With simultaneous T1 down and T3 up perturbations, no T1 adaptation occurred, and T3 adaptation occurred only if T2 was also produced. Identification accuracy with stimuli representing adapted productions was comparable to baseline, but with simulated non-adapted productions it was reduced for T2 and T3. Thus, Mandarin speakers' adaptation to F0 perturbations is linguistically constrained and serves to maintain tone contrast.												6	9												2018	33	6					734	749		10.1080/23273798.2017.1421317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2017.1421317												2026-01-16	WOS:000431587000006

Methodology: 21 first language Urdu second language Cantonese children (ages 4-6) and 20 age-matched first language Cantonese children participated in a picture-naming experiment with 86 words (109 syllables in total). Data and Analysis: Acoustic analysis was carried out for perceptually correct and incorrect tone productions of each tone. Comparisons were also made across speaker groups regarding accuracy rates and error patterns. Findings: Overall, first-language Urdu participants had lower accuracy and greater tone confusion than first language Cantonese participants. The pattern is attributable to influence from Urdu prosody, ongoing Cantonese tone mergers, and general sensitivity to phonetic information. Originality: This is the first empirical study on the acquisition of Cantonese tones by children who are heritage speakers of a non-tone language.												7	7											AUG	2020	24	4					767	782	1367006919884659	10.1177/1367006919884659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367006919884659		NOV 2019										2026-01-16	WOS:000495564000001

M.; Liu, Fang			The form and function processing of lexical tone and intonation in tone-language-speaking children with autism spectrum disorder	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Studies on how the form versus function aspect of tone and intonation is processed by autistic individuals have mainly focused on speakers of non-tonal languages (e.g., English) with equivocal results. While the samples' heterogeneous cognitive abilities may be contributing factors, the phenotype of tone and intonation processing in autism may also vary with one's language background. Thirty-eight cognitively able autistic and 32 non-autistic Mandarin-speaking children completed tone and intonation perception tasks, each containing a function and form condition. Results suggested that the abilities to discriminate tone and intonation were not impaired at either the form or function level in these autistic children, and that these abilities were positively associated with one another in both autistic and non-autistic groups. The more severe the autism symptoms, the worse the form- and function-level of tone and intonation processing. While enhanced tone and intonation processing has been found in a subgroup of autistic children, it may not be a general characteristic of the autistic population with long-term tone language experience. These findings reveal typical tone and intonation processing at both the form and function levels in cognitively able Mandarin-speaking autistic children and provide evidence for associated tone and intonation processing abilities across levels.												5	5											JUL	2023	154	1					467	481		10.1121/10.0020271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0020271												2026-01-16	WOS:001036228000003

Prior research largely focuses on learning from a single language input, where a referent co-occurs with a single word (1:1 mapping). Here, we tested adults' SWL from a simulated bilingual environment, where one referent co-occurred with two words (2:1 mapping) and the two words were either differentiated by a linguistic cue (Mandarin lexical tones, Cued condition) or not (Uncued condition). Results showed that in the Cued condition, Chinese-English bilinguals (N = 38) outperformed Spanish-English bilinguals (N = 56) and English monolinguals (N = 55), while Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals performed similarly. The three groups did not differ in the Uncued condition. Self-reported learning confidence and strategies showed limited conscious awareness of learning. Results demonstrate that familiarity with a linguistic cue boosts overall statistical word learning from bilingual input.												1	1											NOV	2024	27	5					886	900		10.1017/S1366728923000858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728923000858		DEC 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001122520100001

Lexical and Prosodic Pitch Modifications in Cantonese Infant-directed Speech	JOURNAL OF CHILD LANGUAGE				Article								The functions of acoustic-phonetic modifications in infant-directed speech (IDS) remain a question: do they specifically serve to facilitate language learning via enhanced phonemic contrasts (the hyperarticulation hypothesis) or primarily to improve communication via prosodic exaggeration (the prosodic hypothesis)? The study of lexical tones provides a unique opportunity to shed light on this, as lexical tones are phonemically contrastive, yet their primary cue, pitch, is also a prosodic cue. This study investigated Cantonese IDS and found increased intra-talker variation of lexical tones, which more likely posed a challenge to rather than facilitated phonetic learning. Although tonal space was expanded which could facilitate phonetic learning, its expansion was a function of overall intonational modifications. Similar findings were observed in speech to pets who should not benefit from larger phonemic distinction. We conclude that lexical-tone adjustments in IDS mainly serve to broadly enhance communication rather than specifically increase phonemic contrast for learners.												16	17											NOV	2021	48	6					1235	1261	PII S0305000920000707	10.1017/S0305000920000707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305000920000707												2026-01-16	WOS:000721289100009

The impact of segmental familiarity on incidental suprasegmental category learning	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Previous research on tone category learning has suggested that the learners' familiarity with the segmental composition of tokens can impact learning. However, the impact of segmental familiarity on tone category learning has seldom been tested. Also, the learning of novel tone categories in natural speech has been studied primarily under explicit learning paradigms. In the current study, we expand the use of incidental learning paradigms from synthesized sound category learning to natural speech to examine the impact of segmental familiarity on tone category learning. In one online session, three groups of native English speakers from multiple countries learned four Thai tone categories presented in tokens with familiar or unfamiliar vowel segments. Results demonstrated that incidental learning is a quick and effective method for studying novel sound category acquisition, with learners in each group achieving up to 100% identification accuracy at test. Using this paradigm, we observed a small impact of segmental familiarity on learning, suggesting that its influence may be highly granular, depending on the type and complexity of segmental features in the stimuli.												0	0											JUL	2025	158	1					291	308		10.1121/10.0037075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0037075												2026-01-16	WOS:001525855900001
J	Chui, YT; Lai, SS; Qin, QZ				Chui, Yin-To; Lai, Susu; Qin, Quentin Zhen			Aging and distributional tone learning: the role of pitch memory in older adults' discrimination of mandarin lexical tones	LANGUAGE AND COGNITION				Article								Distributional learning enables listeners to form phonetic categories by extracting statistical regularities from speech input. Younger Cantonese speakers can acquire the Mandarin level-falling (T1-T4) contrast through distributional learning, with bimodal exposure facilitating category formation and unimodal exposure suppressing it, and with fine-grained pitch sensitivity predicting success. However, aging is associated with declines in pitch sensitivity and phonetic boundary formation, which may disrupt this process. This study examined whether Cantonese-speaking older adults exhibit distributional learning of Mandarin T1-T4 and whether individual cognitive factors predict learning success. Sixty-four participants completed a pretest-training-posttest procedure with bimodal or unimodal exposure. While older adults improved in tone discrimination, no group differences emerged. Further analysis showed that those with lower pitch-related auditory memory failed to learn from unimodal input. On the other hand, fine-grained pitch perception abilities did not predict learning outcomes. These results suggest that older adults may rely on alternative learning mechanisms, such as memory-based strategies, when exposed to ambiguous input distributions. The findings indicate a shift from perceptual encoding to memory-driven processing in aging and highlight the limits of passive statistical learning in older adulthood.												0	0											OCT 15	2025	17								e80	10.1017/langcog.2025.10035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2025.10035												2026-01-16	WOS:001592937300001

Infants' discrimination of novel vowels in song	INFANCY				Article								When adults speak or sing with infants, they sound differently than in adult communication. Infant-directed (ID) communication helps caregivers to regulate infants' emotions and helps infants to process speech information, at least from ID-speech. However, it is largely unclear whether infants might also process speech information presented in ID-singing. Therefore, we examined whether infants discriminate vowels in ID-singing, as well as potential differences with ID-speech. Using an alternating trial preference procedure, infants aged 4-6 and 8-10 months were tested on their discrimination of an unfamiliar non-native vowel contrast presented in ID-like speech and singing. Relying on models of early speech sound perception, we expected that infants in their first half year of life would discriminate the vowels, in contrast to older infants whose non-native sound perception should deteriorate, at least in ID-like speech. Our results showed that infants of both age groups were able to discriminate the vowels in ID-like singing, while only the younger group discriminated the vowels in ID-like speech. These results show that infants process speech sound information in song from early on. They also hint at diverging perceptual or attentional mechanisms guiding infants' sound processing in ID-speech versus ID-singing toward the end of the first year of life.												8	9											MAR	2021	26	2					248	270		10.1111/infa.12387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12387		FEB 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000613396300001

SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING				Article								Objective: Evaluate the fundamental frequency (fo) variabilty of spontaneous cries produced by neonates with tonal (Lamnso) and non-tonal (German) ambient language. Study Design: Populational prospective study. Participants: A total of 21 German infants (10 male) and 21 Cameroon (Nso) infants (10 male) within the first week of life served as participants. Methods: Spontaneously uttered cries by each infant were audio recorded. The cries were acoustically analyzed and measures of fo variability (pitch sigma, fo fluctuation, fo range) were calculated. Cry duration and anthropometric measures were calculated as co-factors. Results: Significant group differences were found for all fo variability measures, whereas somatic measures did not differ. Cry duration also differed significantly between groups. The results were indicative of Cameroon (Nso) infants producing cries with more fo variability compared to German infants. Conclusion: Albeit further studies with a larger sample size are warranted, the data foster previous findings of an early imprinting effect of the ambient maternal language on cry fo.												28	31												2016	19	4					211	217		10.1080/2050571X.2016.1187903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2050571X.2016.1187903												2026-01-16	WOS:000409165300003

Differential sensitivity to changes in pitch acceleration in the auditory brainstem and cortex	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								The cortical pitch-specific response (CPR) is differentially sensitive to pitch contours varying in rate of accelerationtime-time-variant Mandarin Tone 2 (T2) versus constant, linear rising ramp (Linear)-as a function of language experience (Krishnan, Gandour, & Suresh, 2014). CPR and brainstem frequency following response (FFR) data were recorded concurrently from native Mandarin listeners using the same stimuli. Results showed that T2 elicited larger responses than Linear at both cortical and brainstem levels (CPR: Na-Pb, Pb-Nb; FFR). However, Pb-Nb exhibited a larger difference in magnitude between T2 and Linear than either Na-Pb or FFR. This finding highlights differential weighting of brain responses elicited by a specific temporal attribute of pitch. Consistent with the notion of a distributed, integrated hierarchical pitch processing network, temporal attributes of pitch are differentially weighted by subcortical and cortical level processing.

The present event-related potential (ERP) study examined how sandhi words are processed during dialogue comprehension. Following different wh-questions, the answers embedded a sandhi word in which the first syllable was either pronounced as post-sandhi T3, pre-sandhi T3, or mispronounced T4 at the focus or background position. The results showed that the naturalness rating decreased as the amplitude of a late positivity (LPC) increased in the order of post-sandhi, pre-sandhi, and mispronunciation conditions, reflecting a reanalysis process after encountering the unexpected tone. At the background (vs. focus) position, the effect was more posterior for the mispronunciation condition, and disappeared for the pre-sandhi condition. Our data suggest that the processing of sandhi words is not only influenced by their tonal realisation, but also moderated by their information structural status.												0	0											NOV 26	2022	37	10					1207	1219		10.1080/23273798.2022.2030482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2022.2030482		JAN 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000748199700001

However, most of this research has tested Asian tone languages, particularly those which have many tonal contrasts and a dense tone-to-syllable association. In this paper we investigate the mental representation of derived tones in Bemba, a Bantu language that has a two-way tone contrast but which shows robust tone spreading patterns. Specifically, we test ternary high-tone spreading, a process that is unique from a phonological perspective. In a production task we test whether ternary spread can be extended to non-words. We complement this with an AX discrimination task comparing binary vs ternary spread, which are phonologically contrastive, on the one hand, with a tonally similarly salient but non-phonologically relevant contrast, on the other. We show that in both the production and percep- tion of non-words, ternary spread is distinct from binary spread, suggesting that derived tone is equally mentally represented as lexical tone is in Asian tone languages.												2	3												2015	33	3			SI		307	323		10.2989/16073614.2015.1108768	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16073614.2015.1108768												2026-01-16	WOS:000367103700006

The present study is designed to dissociate these two kinds of effects and further investigate the processing of lexical tones at pre-attentive stage by mismatch negativity (MMN). We chose level tones and contour tones in Cantonese to differentiate pitch height from pitch contour, and manipulated tonal category (within-category/across-category) to distinguish phonological information from acoustic information. The results showed clear interactions between tonal category and pitch type in MMN mean amplitude and peak latency, suggesting the interaction between phonological information and pitch type in the pre-attentive processing of lexical tones. These results are discussed in light of cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing of lexical tones.												21	21												2017	32	9					1164	1175		10.1080/23273798.2017.1310909	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2017.1310909												2026-01-16	WOS:000411462800007
J	Antoniou, M; To, CKS; Wong, PCM				Antoniou, Mark; To, Carol K. S.; Wong, Patrick C. M.			Auditory cues that drive language development are language specific: Evidence from Cantonese	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS				Article								The mechanisms that allow for both language-specific and universal constraints in language development are not fully understood. According to the rhythm detection hypothesis, sensitivity to rhythm is the underlying mechanism that is fundamental to language development. Support from a number of Western languages, as well as Mandarin, has led to the proposal that rhythm detection may provide a language-universal account of language development. However, claims of universality may be premature because most research has addressed reading (rather than language) development, only a small number of languages have been investigated, and pitch is a better predictor of reading than rhythm in Mandarin children. Therefore, we examined language development using a narrative story-retelling task in children who speak Cantonese (a more complex tone inventory than Mandarin) and also assessed temporal and pitch-based auditory abilities to consider whether temporal processing drives development in a tone language. Both temporal and pitch abilities correlated with language development, but only pitch explained unique variance in language after age. The findings support the role of basic auditory processing mechanisms in language development, but they extend beyond the rhythm detection hypothesis by demonstrating that the fundamental cues for development are dependent on the specific processing demands of each language, rather than being universal.												12	13											NOV	2015	36	6					1493	1507		10.1017/S0142716414000514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0142716414000514												2026-01-16	WOS:000368233000008

This study investigated Chinese and English speakers' eye movements when they were asked to identify audiovisual Mandarin lexical tones. The Chinese and English speakers were presented with an audiovisual clip of Mandarin monosyllables (for instance, /a/, /a/, /i/, /i/) and were asked to identify whether the syllables were a dipping tone (/a/, / i/) or a falling tone (/ a/, /i/). These audiovisual syllables were presented in clear, noisy and silent (absence of audio signal) conditions. An eye-tracker recorded the participants' eye movements. Results showed that the participants gazed more at the mouth than the eyes. In addition, when acoustic conditions became adverse, both the Chinese and English speakers increased their gaze duration at the mouth rather than at the eyes. The findings suggested that the mouth is the primary area that listeners utilise in their perception of audiovisual lexical tones. The similar eye movements between the Chinese and English speakers imply that the mouth acts as a perceptual cue that provides articulatory information, as opposed to social and pragmatic information.												0	0												2023	16	4							4	10.16910/jemr.16.4.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.16910/jemr.16.4.4												2026-01-16	WOS:001113951500002
J	Chen, F; Loizou, PC				Chen, Fei; Loizou, Philipos C.			Predicting the intelligibility of vocoded and wideband Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Due to the limited number of cochlear implantees speaking Mandarin Chinese, it is extremely difficult to evaluate new speech coding algorithms designed for tonal languages. Access to an intelligibility index that could reliably predict the intelligibility of vocoded (and non-vocoded) Mandarin Chinese is a viable solution to address this challenge. The speech-transmission index (STI) and coherence- based intelligibility measures, among others, have been examined extensively for predicting the intelligibility of English speech but have not been evaluated for vocoded or wideband (non-vocoded) Mandarin speech despite the perceptual differences between the two languages. The results indicated that the coherence-based measures seem to be influenced by the characteristics of the spoken language. The highest correlation (r = 0.91-0.97) was obtained in Mandarin Chinese with a weighted coherence measure that included primarily information from high-intensity voiced segments (e. g., vowels) containing F0 information, known to be important for lexical tone recognition. In contrast, in English, highest correlation was obtained with a coherence measure that included information from weak consonants and vowel/ consonant transitions. A band-importance function was proposed that captured information about the amplitude envelope contour. A higher modulation rate (100 Hz) was found necessary for the STI-based measures for maximum correlation (r = 0.94-0.96) with vocoded Mandarin and English recognition.

However, more than 60% of the world's population speaks tonal languages. Mandarin is the most spoken tonal languages in the world. Interestingly, the use of tone in tonal languages may represent different meanings of words and reflect feelings, which is very different from nontonal languages. The objective of this study is to determine whether a spoken Mandarin sentence with or without tone can be distinguished by analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. We first constructed a new Brain Research Center Speech (BRCSpeech) database to recognize Mandarin. The EEG data of 14 participants were recorded, while they articulated preselected sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the method of asymmetric feature extraction method for speech recognition using EEG signals. This study shows that the feature extraction method of rational asymmetry (RASM) can achieve the best accuracy in the classification of cross-subjects. In addition, our proposed binomial variable algorithm methodology can achieve 98.82% accuracy in cross-subject classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of eight channels [(F7, F8), (C5, C6), (P5, P6), and (O1, O2)] can achieve an accurate of 94.44%. This study explores the neurophysiological correlation of Mandarin pronunciation, which can help develop a tonal language synthesis system based on BCI in the future.												5	6											DEC	2022	14	4					1666	1677		10.1109/TCDS.2021.3137251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2021.3137251												2026-01-16	WOS:000916821100031
J	Althaus, N; Wetterlin, A; Lahiri, A				Althaus, Nadja; Wetterlin, Allison; Lahiri, Aditi			Features of low functional load in mono- and bilinguals' lexical access: evidence from Swedish tonal accent	PHONETICA				Article								Swedish makes use of tonal accents (Accents 1 and 2) to contrast words, but the functional load is very low, with some regional dialects not even exhibiting the contrast. In particular given the low number of minimal pairs, the question is whether tonal word accent is used in lexical access. Here we present two cross-modal fragment semantic priming studies in order to address this question. Both experiments use first syllable fragments in order to prime semantically related targets. Experiment 1 utilises words whose first syllable occurs with both accent patterns, creating a situation in which there is lexical competition between words that differ solely in terms of accent. Experiment 2 removes this competition by using words that have no such accent competitors. Our results show that native speakers of Swedish use tonal word accent in lexical access: Accent mispronunciations failed to prime semantically related targets, regardless of whether primes had accent competitors or not. Results for a group of early bilingual speakers (who grew up with one Swedish-speaking parent and one other non-tonal language) showed no differences in processing compared to the monolinguals. This indicates that the extraction of accent features during acquisition and their use in lexical access is robust, even in a scenario where multiple input languages lead to tonal word accent being a useful feature for only some of the lexical items that are being acquired. There is no doubt that the accent system is well entrenched into the bilinguals' phonological system.												5	5												2021	78	3					175	199		10.1515/phon-2021-2002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/phon-2021-2002												2026-01-16	WOS:000705492900001

The Ability to Use Contextual Cues to Achieve Phonological Constancy Emerges by 14 Months	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								The ability to map similar sounding words to different meanings alone is far from enough for successful speech processing. To overcome variability in the speech signal, young learners must also recognize words across surface variations. Previous studies have shown that infants at 14 months are able to use variations in word-internal cues (i.e., acoustic cues within the target word) to form phonological categories and to learn words. The present study takes into consideration the fact that talker variability can easily lead to acoustic overlap between phonological categories, in which case reliance on word-external cues (i.e., acoustic cues in the context preceding and/or following the target word, also referred to as contextual cues) as a frame of reference is obligatory for successful talker adaptation. In a series of experiments, the present study examines when infants are able to use word-external cues to tune to different talkers for the benefit of word learning. Cantonese-learning 14-month-old, 18-month-old, and 24-month-old infants (N = 258) were tested on the associative learning of Cantonese Tone 1-Tone 3 contrast. Results showed that talker variability that yielded acoustic overlap between the two tonal categories compromised infants' ability to map the contrast onto word meanings. However, when given speaker-matched contextual cues, infants as young as 14 months of age demonstrated a certain degree of talker adaptation which may have subserved their use of phonetic details in novel word learning.												3	3											NOV	2022	58	11					2064	2080		10.1037/dev0001418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001418		AUG 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000844823300001
J	Li, L; Hu, TT; Liu, ST				Li, Luan; Hu, Tingting; Liu, Shuting			Graded phonological neighborhood effects on lexical retrieval: Evidence from Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE				Article								How phonological neighborhood affects lexical retrieval can shed important light on lexical organization and processing. Yet these effects are unclear, particularly in Mandarin Chinese. This is likely because the working definition of phonological neighbors (i.e., the one-phoneme edit rule) used in Indo-European languages inadequately characterizes the phonological similarity among Mandarin words, which have simpler syllable structures and lexical tones. The current study proposes a graded Mandarin phonological neighborhood and investigates the impacts of near-to-distant Mandarin phonological neighbors on lexical retrieval. In Study 1, we investigated how Mandarin phonological similarity is influenced by the editing of lexical tone, constituent (onset/rime, initial/ final) and phoneme. Native Mandarin speakers rated the similarity between the edited monosyllabic words. We found that constituent-edit neighbors were rated as the most dissimilar, followed by phoneme-edit neighbors, while tone-edit neighbors were the most similar. In Study 2, we calculated the constituent-, phoneme- and toneedit phonological neighborhood densities and frequencies for 4,706 monosyllabic Mandarin words. We then utilized extant datasets to examine how the density and frequency of neighbors at varied distances, as well as of homophonic neighbors, impact response latencies in word naming, visual lexical decision, and picture naming tasks. The results showed that graded phonological neighbors had differential impacts on lexical retrieval efficiency: distant (constituent-edit) neighbors facilitated word retrieval, while near (phoneme-, tone-edit and homophonic) neighbors had inhibitory effects. We discuss these findings within an interactive activation and competition framework and suggest future directions to study the representation and processing of the Mandarin phonological lexicon.												3	4											AUG	2024	137								104526	10.1016/j.jml.2024.104526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2024.104526		APR 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001220154600001
J	Liu, YT				Liu, Yeu-Ting			Focus on Form as a Pedagogical Framework for Fostering a Native-like Mandarin Tonal Identification System	LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS				Article								Second-language acquisition (SLA) research has shown that given short-term intensive form-focused training, non-native Mandarin speakers are able to establish a categorical tonal representation, which allows them to identify systematically features of tones borne by isolated words. However, developing a categorical tonal inventory is a necessary but insufficient condition for a native-like tonal identification system. Native Mandarin speakers' tonal inventory is well connected to the mental lexicon, which allows them to efficiently resolve any tonal ambiguities resulting from phonemic sandhi or phonetic transformation in connected speech. Existing L2 form-focused training programs, as seen in Sun (1997), have not shown positive effects on entrenching the link between the tonal inventory and the mental lexicon. Drawing upon the insights from studies conducted within the framework of focus on form (FonF)-a pedagogical intervention used to direct learners' attention to the formal aspect of a linguistic construction in meaning-oriented activities, this paper contends that implicit FonF, when taken into consideration of L2 learners' internal learning agenda and universal processing strategies, can provide an optimal encoding environment for internalizing intricate tonal behaviors. To this end, this paper first elucidates "what do native and non-native tonal speakers actually do?" when identifying tone in connected speech. Based upon the reviewed literature, the paper then discusses issues that need to be considered in L2 tonal instruction, and proposes how FonF pedagogical guidelines may be used to remediate problematic tonal tokens in context and hence foster an efficient tonal identification system for non-native tonal speakers-a domain rarely discussed under the FonF framework and in the SLA literature.												3	3											JUL	2011	12	3					627	667															2026-01-16	WOS:000293194900005
J	Wiener, S; Turnbull, R				Wiener, Seth; Turnbull, Rory			Constraints of Tones, Vowels and Consonants on Lexical Selection in Mandarin Chinese	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Previous studies have shown that when speakers of European languages are asked to turn nonwords into words by altering either a vowel or consonant, they tend to treat vowels as more mutable than consonants. These results inspired the universal vowel mutability hypothesis: listeners learn to cope with vowel variability because vowel information constrains lexical selection less tightly and allows for more potential candidates than does consonant information. The present study extends the word reconstruction paradigm to Mandarin Chinese-a Sino-Tibetan language, which makes use of lexically contrastive tone. Native speakers listened to word-like nonwords (e.g., su3) and were asked to change them into words by manipulating a single consonant (e.g., tu3), vowel (e.g., si3), or tone (e.g., su4). Additionally, items were presented in a fourth condition in which participants could change any part. The participants' reaction times and responses were recorded. Results revealed that participants responded faster and more accurately in both the free response and the tonal change conditions. Unlike previous reconstruction studies on European languages, where vowels were changed faster and more often than consonants, these results demonstrate that, in Mandarin, changes to vowels and consonants were both overshadowed by changes to tone, which was the preferred modification to the stimulus nonwords, while changes to vowels were the slowest and least accurate. Our findings show that the universal vowel mutability hypothesis is not consistent with a tonal language, that Mandarin tonal information is lower-priority than consonants and vowels and that vowel information most tightly constrains Mandarin lexical access.												81	84											MAR	2016	59	1					59	82		10.1177/0023830915578000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830915578000												2026-01-16	WOS:000372902300003
J	Chen, A; Zhao, R; Huang, G; Li, AJ; Cheung, H				Chen, Ao; Zhao, Ru; Huang, Gan; Li, Aijun; Cheung, Hintat			Successful lexical tone production of Mandarin Chinese autistic children with intellectual impairment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS				Article								BackgroundAtypical speech prosody has been commonly found among autistic children. Yet it remains unknown whether prosody impairment originates from poor pitch ability in general or whether it is the result of the difficulty in understanding and using prosody for communicative purposes. AimsTo investigate whether native Mandarin Chinese-speaking autistic children with intellectual impairment were able to accurately produce native lexical tones, which are pitch patterns that distinguish word meaning lexically and serve little social purpose. Methods & ProceduresUsing a picture-naming task, thirteen 8-13-year-old Mandarin Chinese-speaking autistic children with intellectual impairment were tested on their production of Chinese lexical tones. Chronical age-matched typically developing (TD) children were included as the control group. Perceptual assessment and phonetic analyses were conducted with the produced lexical tones. Outcomes & ResultsThe majority of the lexical tones produced by the autistic children were perceived as accurate by adult judges. Phonetic analysis of the pitch contours found no significant difference between the two groups, and the autistic children and TD children used the phonetic features in comparable ways when differentiating the lexical tones. However, the lexical tone accuracy rate was lower among the autistic children than among the TDs, and the larger individual difference was observed among the autistic children than the TD children. Conclusions & ImplicationsThese results indicate that autistic children are able to produce the global contours of the lexical tones, and pitch deficits do not seem to qualify as a core feature of autism. What this paper addsWhat is already known on the subjectAtypical prosody has been considered a maker of the speech of autistic children, and meta-analysis found a significant difference in mean pitch and pitch range between TD children and autistic children. Yet it remains unknown whether the pitch deficits are the result of impaired perceptual-motoric ability or if they reflect failure in learning sentential prosody, which requires an understanding of the interlocutors' mind. In addition, research on pitch ability of autistic children with intellectual disabilities has been scarce, and whether these children are able to produce pitch variation is largely unknown. What this paper adds to existing knowledgeWe tested native Mandarin Chinese autistic children with intellectual impairment on their production of native lexical tones. The lexical tones in Chinese are pitch variations realized on individual syllables that distinguish lexical meaning, but they do not serve social pragmatic purposes. We found that although these autistic children had only developed limited spoken language, the majority of their lexical tones were perceived as accurate. They were able to use the phonetic features in comparable ways with the TD children when distinguishing the lexical tones. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?It seems unlikely that pitch processing at the lexical level is fundamentally impaired in autistic children, and pitch deficits do not seem to qualify for a core feature of their speech. Practitioners should be cautious when using pitch production as a clinical marker for autistic children.												1	1											NOV	2023	58	6					1912	1926		10.1111/1460-6984.12881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12881		MAY 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000979966600001
J	Zhou, N; Zhang, W; Lee, CY; Xu, L				Zhou, Ning; Zhang, Wenle; Lee, Chao-Yang; Xu, Li			Lexical tone recognition with an artificial neural network	EAR AND HEARING				Article								Objectives: Tone production is particularly important for communicating in tone languages such as Mandarin Chinese. In the present study, an artificial neural network was used to recognize tones produced by adult native speakers. The purposes of the study were (1) to test the sensitivity of the neural network to speaker variation typically in adult speaker groups, (2) to evaluate two normalization procedures to overcome the effects of speaker variation, and (3) to compare tone recognition performance of the neural network with that of the human listeners. Design: A feedforward multilayer neural network was used. Twenty-nine adult native Mandarin Chinese speakers were recruited to record tone samples. The F0 contours of the vowel part of the 1044 monosyllabic words recorded were extracted using an autocorrelation method. Samples from the F0 contours were used as inputs to the neural network. The efficacy of the neural network was first tested by varying the number of inputs and the number of neurons in the hidden layer from 1 to 16. The sensitivity of the neural network to speaker variation was tested by (1) using the raw F0 data from speech tokens of a number of randomly drawn speakers that varied from 1 to 29, (2) using the raw F0 data from speech tokens of either male-only or female-only speakers, and (3) using two sets of normalized F0 data (i.e., tone 1-based normalization and first-order derivative) from speech tokens from a number of randomly drawn speakers that varied from 1 to 29. The recognition performance of the neural network under several experimental conditions was compared with the corresponding recognition performance of 10 normal-hearing, native Mandarin Chinese speaking adult listeners. Results: Three inputs and four hidden neurons were found to be sufficient for the neural network to perform at about 85% correct using speech samples without normalization. The performance of the neural network was affected by variation across speakers particularly between genders. Using the tone 1-based normalization procedure, the performance of the neural network improved significantly. The recognition accuracy of the neural network as a whole or for each tone was comparable with that of the human listeners. Conclusions: The neural network can be used to evaluate the tone production of Mandarin Chinese speaking adults with human listener-like recognition accuracy. The tone 1-based normalization procedure improves the performance of the neural network to human listener-like accuracy. The success of our neural network in recognizing tones from multiple speakers supports its utility for evaluating tone production. Further testing of the neural network with hearing-impaired speakers might reveal its potential use for clinical evaluation of tone production.												15	20											JUN	2008	29	3					326	335		10.1097/AUD.0b013e3181662c42	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0b013e3181662c42												2026-01-16	WOS:000255626300003

Eight groups of participants, consisting of children of 6 and 8 years from one of four language background (tone or non-tone) x bilingual status (monolingual or bilingual)-Thai monolingual, English monolingual, English-Thai bilingual, and English-Arabic bilingual were trained to perceive the four Mandarin lexical tones. Half the children in each of these eight groups were given auditory-only (AO) training and half auditory-visual (AV) training. In each group Mandarin tone identification was tested before and after (pre- and post-) training with both auditory-only test (ao-test) and auditory-visual test (av test). The effect of training on Mandarin tone identification was minimal for 6-year-olds. On the other hand, 8-year-olds, particularly those with tone language experience showed greater pre- to post-training improvement, and this was best indexed by ao-test trials. Bilingual vs. monolingual background did not facilitate overall improvement due to training, but it did modulate the efficacy of the Training mode: for bilinguals both AO and AV training, and especially AO, resulted in performance gain; but for monolinguals training was most effective with AV stimuli. Again this effect was best indexed by ao-test trials. These results suggest that tone language experience, be it monolingual or bilingual, is a strong predictor of learning unfamiliar tones; that monolinguals learn best from AV training trials and bilinguals from AO training trials; and that there is no metalinguistic advantage due to bilingualism in learning to perceive lexical tones.												2	2											SEP 4	2018	9								1508	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01508	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01508												2026-01-16	WOS:000443657600001
J	Yip, MCW				Yip, Michael C. W.			Cross-situational word learning of Cantonese Chinese	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW				Article								In this study, we recruited 60 native Cantonese speakers to participate in a standard cross-situational word-learning task to explore the cross-situational learning effects of minimal word pairs in Cantonese Chinese. In the cross-situational word-learning task, four different types of word pairs were used: (1) a non-minimal word pair [N]; (2) a consonant minimal word pair [C]; (3) a rime minimal word pair [R]; and (4) a tone minimal word pair [T]. The results showed that the participants could learn the word-referent mapping for all word-pair types, but they performed better on the N and T types than on the other two (i.e., C and R). Together with other previous evidence, these findings suggest that Cantonese language learners can learn and encode those phonetic details while they learn the word-referent co-occurrence probabilities. The results also suggested that the tonal information seemed to be more important than the other phonological components in Cantonese Chinese word learning.												3	3											JUN	2023	30	3					1074	1080		10.3758/s13423-022-02217-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-022-02217-7		NOV 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000884203800001

MMN has been shown to be larger for linguistic units that involves full-form access (lexical MMN enhancement) and smaller for separate but combinable units (combinatorial MMN reduction). Chinse compound words were compared against pseudocompounds, which do not have full-form representations in the long-term memory and are "illegal" combinations. All stimuli were disyllabic (bimorphemic). Word frequency was manipulated with the prediction that low-frequency compounds are more likely processed combinatorially, while high-frequency ones are more likely accessed in full forms. The results showed that low-frequency words elicited smaller MMNs than pseudocompounds, which supported the prediction of combinatorial processing. However, neither MMN enhancement nor reduction was found for high -frequency words. These results were interpreted within the dual-route model framework that assumes simulta-neous access to words and morphemes.												5	5											MAY	2023	187						11	19		10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2023.02.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2023.02.004		FEB 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000948512400001
J	Singh, L; Tan, ARY				Singh, Leher; Tan, Annabel R. Y.			Beyond Perceptual Narrowing: Monolingual and Bilingual Infants Discriminate Hindi Contrasts When Learning Words in the Second Year of Life	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								A significant body of literature has demonstrated that infants demonstrate a decline in sensitivity to nonnative sound contrasts by their first birthday, a transition often thought to be adaptive for later word learning. The present study investigated infants' sensitivity to these contrasts in a habituation-based discrimination and word learning task (total N = 168, 78 males and 90 females). All infants were native to Singapore and were of Chinese origin. Family socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by parental education. The mean number of years of parental education was 4.02 years after high school. Using a habituation-based discrimination paradigm, monolingual, and bilingual infants' sensitivity to the Hindi dental/retroflex voiceless stop was investigated at 14 months (Experiment 1). Neither group discriminated the contrast. Using the Switch paradigm, we assessed sensitivity to the same contrast in a word learning task. Monolingual and bilingual infants were tested at 14- and 19 months (Experiment 2a) and subsequently, an older group of bilingual infants was tested at 24 months (Experiment 2b). Results demonstrated an overall sensitivity to the Hindi contrast in Experiment 2a. Bilingual infants tested in Experiment 2b were not sensitive to the Hindi contrast. Findings are discussed with reference to discontinuities in the growth of a phonological lexicon as well as possible mechanisms elicit nonnative sensitivity in word learning.												14	14											JAN	2021	57	1					19	32		10.1037/dev0001137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001137												2026-01-16	WOS:000604915800002
J	Chandrasekaran, B; Gandour, JT; Krishnan, A				Chandrasekaran, Bharath; Gandour, Jackson T.; Krishnan, Ananthanarayan			Neuroplasticity in the processing of pitch dimensions: A multidimensional scaling analysis of the mismatch negativity	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Purpose: An auditory electrophysiological study was conducted to explore the influence of language experience on the saliency of dimensions underlying cortical pitch processing. Methods: Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to Mandarin tones were recorded in Chinese and English participants (n = 10 per group) using a passive oddball paradigm. Stimuli consisted of three tones (T1: high level; T2: high rising; T3: low falling-rising). There were three oddball conditions (standard/deviant): T1/T2, T1/T3, T2/T3. In the T1/T2 and T1/T3 conditions, each tonal pair represented a contrast between a level and a contour tone; the T2/T3 condition, a contrast between two contour tones. Twenty dissimilarity matrices were created using the MMN mean amplitude measured from the Fz location for each condition per participant, and analyzed by an individual differences multidimensional scaling model. Results: Two pitch dimensions were revealed, interpretively labeled as 'height' and 'contour'. The latter was found to be more important for Chinese than English subjects. Using individual weights on the contour dimension, a discriminant function showed that 17 out of 20 participants were correctly classified into their respective language groups. Conclusions: The MMN can serve as an index of pitch features that are differentially weighted depending on a listener's experience with lexical tones and their acoustic correlates within a particular tone space.												73	92												2007	25	3-4					195	210															2026-01-16	WOS:000251513800002
J	Yang, Y; Dong, LJ; Xia, QS; Yang, YX; Chen, F				Yang, Yu; Dong, Longjie; Xia, Quansheng; Yang, Yuxiao; Chen, Fei			Cross-linguistic similarity in L2 suprasegmental learning: evidence from Chinese learners' perception of Japanese pitch accents	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								The acquisition of suprasegmental features in a second language (L2), like lexical tone and pitch accent, can be challenging, yet the impact of cross-linguistic similarity on learning these suprasegmental features has been underexplored. This study explored the role of cross-linguistic similarity in Chinese learners' perception of Japanese pitch accents, aiming to verify the Perceptual Assimilation Model for Suprasegmentals (PAM-S). In experiment 1, 25 Chinese learners of Japanese with lower proficiency level and 24 learners with higher proficiency level completed a perceptual assimilation task (PAT) that examined the cross-linguistic perceptual similarity between Mandarin tones and Japanese pitch accents. In experiment 2, the same Chinese groups and 35 native Japanese listeners completed a perceptual discrimination test (PDT) of Japanese pitch accent contrasts. Results of PAT showed that Chinese learners successfully categorized Japanese pitch accents into their native Mandarin tone categories: they perceived Japanese H*L as Mandarin Tone 4 (falling tone), LH* as Tone 2 (rising tone), and LH as Tone 1 (level tone). Moreover, results of PDT showed that Chinese learners were able to discriminate H*L-LH* and H*L-LH but had difficulty in the discrimination of LH*-LH. The results also show that Chinese learners' ability to discriminate Japanese pitch accent contrasts did not improve consistently with increased Japanese experience. This study argues that the LH*-LH contrast is hard for L2 learners regardless of their L2 experience, because of these two accents' acoustic similarity. The results extended the PAM-S, suggesting that L2 speech perception could be influenced by both the L1-L2 assimilation patterns and acoustic similarity. (c) 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted an eye-tracking experiment and an event-related potential (ERP) experiment to investigate phonological prediction effect in Mandarin comprehension. In Experiment 1, comprehenders utilise the tone of the number (e.g. "yi4[one]") to predict the tone of the upcoming classifier and its corresponding object (e.g. "yi4 zhang1 you2piao4[one ZHANG stamp]", means "a stamp"), leading to more fixation on the target object than the competitors (e.g. "yi2 liang4 dan1che1[one LIANG bike]", means "a bike") in the time window of the number. In Experiment 2, the mismatched tone induced a larger negative response than the matched tone (e.g. [yi2] vs. [yi4] for "a stamp"). These findings provide evidence for the tonal prediction effect, in which lexical tone can serve as a valuable cue for predicting upcoming words.												1	1											SEP 14	2025	40	8					1030	1046		10.1080/23273798.2025.2506637	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2025.2506637		MAY 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001493091800001

The present study investigated whether such category overlap gives rise to perceptual ambiguity and, if so, whether listeners are able to reduce this ambiguity using contextual information. In the first experiment, native Cantonese-speaking listeners were asked to identify isolated Cantonese level tones produced by 7 talkers. Identification accuracy was significantly higher when the presentation of items was blocked by talker rather mixed across talkers. In the second experiment, listeners identified the final (target) tone of 6-syllable semantically neutral sentences with f(0) patterns of the context (i.e., the first 5 syllables) altered. The same target tone was identified differently depending on the context. In the third experiment, the context portions of stimulus sentences from the second experiment were divided into 2 halves, and their f(0) patterns were altered independently. In identifying the target tone, listeners relied more heavily on the f(0) pattern of the second (last) half of the context. These results are discussed in relation to characteristic inter- and intratalker variations of lexical tones.												129	149											APR	2003	46	2					413	421		10.1044/1092-4388(2003/034)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2003/034)												2026-01-16	WOS:000184906200016

Swedish word accents offer a prime testing ground to better understand this division. Although similar to lexical tones, word accents are determined by words' morphosyntactic structure, which enables listeners to use the tone at the beginning of a word to predict its grammatical ending. We recorded electrophysiological and hemodynamic brain responses to words where stem tones matched or mismatched inflectional suffixes. Tones produced brain potential effects after 136 ms, correlating with subject variability in average BOLD in left primary auditory cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Invalidly cued suffixes activated the left inferior parietal lobe, arguably reflecting increased processing cost of their meaning. Thus, interaction of word accent tones with grammatical morphology yielded a rapid neural response correlating in subject variability with activations in predominantly left-hemispheric brain areas.

J	Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO				Liu, Min; Chen, Yiya; Schiller, Niels O.			Online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin: Evidence from ERPs	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the online processing of tone and intonation in Mandarin at the attentive stage. We examined the behavioral and electrophysiological responses of native Mandarin listeners to Mandarin sentences, which contrast in final tones (rising Tone2 or falling Tone4) and intonations (Question or Statement). A clear P300 effect was observed for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone4, but no ERP effect was found for question-statement contrast in sentences ending with Tone2. Our results provide ERP evidence for the interaction of tone and intonation in Mandarin, confirming the findings with behavioral metalinguistic data that native Mandarin listeners can distinguish between question intonation and statement intonation when the intonation is associated with a final Tone4, but fail to do so when the intonation is associated with a final Tone2. Our study extended the understanding of online processing of tone and intonation (1) from the pre-attentive stage to the attentive stage and (2) within a larger domain (i.e. multi-word utterances) than a single word utterance.

Speech stimuli were Mandarin Chinese rising and dipping lexical tones and the musical stimuli were three-note melodies with pitch levels based on those of the lexical tones. Mismatch responses were elicited using a non-attentive oddball paradigm. Adults showed mismatch negativity (MMN) responses in both the lexical tone and music conditions. For infants, for the lexical tones, a positive-mismatch response (p-MMR) was observed at 4, 8, and 12 months, whereas for the musical tones, a p-MMR was found for the 4-month-olds, an MMN for the 12-month-olds, and no mismatch response, either positive or negative, for the 8-month-olds. No evidence of cross-domain correlation of the mismatch responses was found. These results suggest domain-specific development of mismatch responses to pitch change in the first year of life.												7	7											OCT 21	2022	37	9					1153	1168		10.1080/23273798.2022.2051571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2022.2051571		MAR 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000772363700001
J	Norrman, G; Bylund, E; Thierry, G				Norrman, Gunnar; Bylund, Emanuel; Thierry, Guillaume			Irreversible Specialization for Speech Perception in Early International Adoptees	CEREBRAL CORTEX				Article								In early childhood, the human brain goes through a period of tuning to native speech sounds but retains remarkable flexibility, allowing the learning of new languages throughout life. However, little is known about the stability over time of early neural specialization for speech and its influence on the formation of novel language representations. Here, we provide evidence that early international adoptees, who lose contact with their native language environment after adoption, retain enhanced sensitivity to a native lexical tone contrast more than 15 years after being adopted to Sweden from China, in the absence of any pretest familiarization with the stimuli. Changes in oscillatory brain activity showed how adoptees resort to inhibiting the processing of defunct phonological representations, rather than forgetting or replacing them with new ones. Furthermore, neurophysiological responses to native and nonnative contrasts were not negatively correlated, suggesting that native language retention does not interfere with the acquisition of adoptive phonology acquisition. These results suggest that early language experience provides strikingly resilient specialization for speech which is compensated for through inhibitory control mechanisms as learning conditions change later in life.												8	9											AUG 22	2022	32	17					3777	3785		10.1093/cercor/bhab447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab447		DEC 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000756727000001

The language selected for investigation was Thai, a tone language with five lexical tones: mid, low, falling, high and rising. Twenty speakers participated in the experiment: 10 ''young'' male speakers and 10 ''old'' speakers, 5 male and 5 female. High-quality tape recordings were obtained of each subject's productions of a minimal set of five monosyllabic words. F0 contours were extracted by a cepstral analysis. A comparison was made of inter- and intraspeaker variability in the production of the five Thai tones. Results of analysis of variance indicated that the degree of intersubject variability in F0 was greater than intraspeaker across all five tones, that young and old speakers exhibited the same pattern of variability, and that variability in tone production differed depending on the lexical tone. The falling and rising tones exhibited smaller degrees of variability than the mid, low or high. Findings are interpreted to highlight the nature of F0 variability, the relationship of F0 variability to amount of F0 movement, and crosslinguistic differences in F0 variability as a function of prosodic structure.												21	25											NOV	1991	10	4					355	372		10.1016/0167-6393(91)90003-C	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-6393(91)90003-C												2026-01-16	WOS:A1991GW01900003

Tones are frequently identified as one of the most challenging aspects of phonology for Mandarin L2 learners to acquire. In this study, tone productions of bilingual children from three home language backgrounds, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin Chinese, were compared for transcribed accuracy using mixed effects logistic regression. In addition, the fundamental frequency contours of correct tone productions were fitted with generalized additive mixed models to analyse the acoustic differences between groups. Error patterns were also analysed for possible Cantonese substitutions. Our results suggest that children with a Cantonese background are more accurate in tone productions than children with an English language background, but they also made more errors than their peers with a Mandarin language background. These findings suggest that a tonal language background could result in positive transfer among school-age children who are in the early stages of learning Mandarin as an L2.												6	6											FEB	2024	155	2					1608	1623		10.1121/10.0024985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0024985												2026-01-16	WOS:001172969100001

Cortical pitch response components show differential sensitivity to native and nonnative pitch contours	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								The aim of this study is to evaluate how nonspeech pitch contours of varying shape influence latency and amplitude of cortical pitch-specific response (CPR) components differentially as a function of language experience. Stimuli included time-varying, high rising Mandarin Tone 2 (T2) and linear rising ramp (Linear), and steady-state (Flat). Both the latency and magnitude of CPR components were differentially modulated by (i) the overall trajectory of pitch contours (time-varying vs. steady-state), (ii) their pitch acceleration rates (changing vs. constant), and (iii) their linguistic status (lexical vs. non-lexical). T2 elicited larger amplitude than Linear in both language groups, but size of the effect was larger in Chinese than English. The magnitude of CPR components elicited by T2 were larger for Chinese than English at the right temporal electrode site. Using the CPR, we provide evidence in support of experience-dependent modulation of dynamic pitch contours at an early stage of sensory processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Varying irrelevant phonetic features hinders learning of the feature being trained	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Learning to distinguish nonnative words that differ in a critical phonetic feature can be difficult. Speech training studies typically employ methods that explicitly direct the learner's attention to the relevant nonnative feature to be learned. However, studies on vision have demonstrated that perceptual learning may occur implicitly, by exposing learners to stimulus features, even if they are irrelevant to the task, and it has recently been suggested that this task-irrelevant perceptual learning framework also applies to speech. In this study, subjects took part in a seven-day training regimen to learn to distinguish one of two nonnative features, namely, voice onset time or lexical tone, using explicit training methods consistent with most speech training studies. Critically, half of the subjects were exposed to stimuli that varied not only in the relevant feature, but in the irrelevant feature as well. The results showed that subjects who were trained with stimuli that varied in the relevant feature and held the irrelevant feature constant achieved the best learning outcomes. Varying both features hindered learning and generalization to new stimuli.

J	Yuen, KCP; Yuan, M				Yuen, Kevin C. P.; Yuan, Meng			Development of Spatial Release From Masking in Mandarin-Speaking Children With Normal Hearing	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: This study investigated the development of spatial release from masking in children using closed-set Mandarin disyllabic words and monosyllabic words carrying lexical tones as test stimuli and speech spectrum-weighted noise as a masker. Method: Twenty-six children ages 4-9 years and 12 adults, all with normal hearing, participated in speech recognition tests under 2 conditions: (a) speech and noise spatially mixed and presented from the front (NF), and (b) speech presented from the front with noise spatially separated and presented from the side (NS) with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Performance-SNR psychometric functions were obtained that generated the SNR for a 50% correct score (SNR-50%) as the outcome measure. Results: In the child participants, SNR-50% improved with age in NS but not NF. The difference in SNR-50% between NS and NF-the spatial release from masking (SRM)-increased with age with an average improvement of 0.1-0.15 dB per month. Conclusions: SRM has a long developmental time, at least up to 9 years of age, which is significantly longer than some previous developmental studies have suggested. The child participants had not yet reached the adult SRM performance level. SRM is a potential clinical measure to reflect the maturation of spatial auditory processing.												29	32											OCT	2014	57	5					2005	2023		10.1044/2014_JSLHR-H-13-0060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2014_JSLHR-H-13-0060												2026-01-16	WOS:000348200500034

The impact of tone systems on the categorical perception of lexical tones: An event-related potentials study	LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES				Article								This study investigates the categorical perception (CP) of pitch contours (level and rising) by native listeners of two tone languages, Mandarin and Cantonese, for both speech and nonspeech. Language background was found to modulate participants' behavioural and electrophysiological responses to stimuli presented in an active oddball paradigm, comprising a standard and two equally spaced deviants (within- and across-category). The stimuli were divided into two sets according to the results of a two-alternative forced-choice identification test: a rising set, using a standard that listeners identified as high rising tone, and a level set, using a standard that listeners identified as high level tone. For the rising set, both groups of listeners exhibited CP in terms of their behavioural response. However, only Cantonese listeners exhibited a significant CP effect in terms of P300 amplitude. For the level set, the behavioural data revealed a shift in category boundary due, in part, to the range-frequency effect. According to the d' scores, the CP effect elicited from Mandarin listeners was greater for nonspeech stimuli than for speech, suggesting the presence of a psychophysical boundary. There was no such behavioural contrast for Cantonese listeners. However, Cantonese listeners exhibited a significant CP effect in P300 amplitude that was influenced by the range-frequency effect, as well as a possible secondary phonological boundary. P300 amplitude is believed to index the ease of discrimination of speech stimuli by phonological information. We conclude that Cantonese listeners engaged phonological processing in order to discriminate speech stimuli more efficiently than Mandarin listeners. These findings may be due to the different tonal inventories of Mandarin and Cantonese, with Cantonese listeners required to make finer distinctions in perception of pitch height and slope than Mandarin listeners in order to discriminate the denser tone system of Cantonese.												28	39												2012	27	2					184	209		10.1080/01690965.2010.520493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01690965.2010.520493												2026-01-16	WOS:000302402400002

Word recognition and cognitive profiles of Chinese pre-school children at risk for dyslexia through language delay or familial history of dyslexia	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY				Article								Background: This study sought to identify cognitive abilities that might distinguish Hong Kong Chinese kindergarten children at risk for dyslexia through either language delay or familial history of dyslexia from children who were not at risk and to examine how these abilities were associated with Chinese word recognition. The cognitive skills of interest were syllable awareness, tone detection, rapid automatised naming, visual skill, and morphological awareness. Method: We recruited 36 children whose sibling had been previously diagnosed with dyslexia (familial risk group) and 36 children who were initially reported to have difficulties in preschool literacy acquisition by either teachers or parents and subsequently found to demonstrate clinical at-risk factors in aspects of language by paediatricians (language delayed group); the mean age of these groups was approximately 61 months. Thirty-six children with no such risk factors were matched by age, IQ, and parents' education to the at-risk groups. All children were tested on cognitive skills and Chinese word recognition. Results: Compared to the controls, children in the language delayed group scored significantly lower on all measures, whereas children in the familial risk group performed significantly worse only on tone detection, morphological awareness, and Chinese word recognition. In regression analyses, word recognition was best explained by morphological awareness, tone detection and visual skill. Conclusions: Languag-erelated measures are strongly associated with early reading development and impairment in Hong Kong Chinese children. Tests of tone detection and morphological awareness may be important clinical tools for diagnosing risk for reading problems in young Chinese children. In contrast, Chinese language delay may be associated with broader cognitive impairments as found previously in various Indo-European languages (e.g., Bishop &, Snowling, 2004).												73	87											FEB	2008	49	2					211	218		10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01837.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01837.x												2026-01-16	WOS:000254353700012
J	Shao, J; Zhang, CC				Shao, Jing; Zhang, Caicai			Talker normalization in typical Cantonese-speaking listeners and congenital amusics: Evidence from event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL				Article								Despite the lack of invariance in the mapping between the acoustic signal and phonological representation, typical listeners are capable of using information of a talker's vocal characteristics to recognize phonemes, a process known as "talker normalization". The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100-150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the "active control theory". On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual "anchoring" deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.												9	9												2019	23								101814	10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101814												2026-01-16	WOS:000485804400006
J	Lo, RYH				Lo, Roger Yu-Hsiang			The dual role of post-stop fundamental frequency in the production and perception of stops in Mandarin-English bilinguals	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION				Article								In non-tonal languages with a two-way laryngeal contrast, post-stop fundamental frequency (F0) tends to vary as a function of phonological voicing in stops, and listeners use it as a cue for stop voicing. In tonal languages, F0 is the most important acoustic correlate for tone, and listeners likewise rely heavily on F0 to differentiate tones. Given this ambiguity of F0 in its ability to signal phonological voicing and tone, how do speakers of a tonal language weight it in production and perception? Relatedly, do bilingual speakers of tonal and non-tonal languages use the same weights across different language contexts? To address these questions, the cross-linguistic performances from L1 (first language) Mandarin-L2 (second language) English bilinguals dominant in Mandarin in online production and perception experiments are compared. In the production experiment, the participant read aloud Mandarin and English monosyllabic words, the onsets of which typified their two-way laryngeal contrast. For the perception experiment, which utilized a forced-choice identification paradigm, both the English and Mandarin versions shared the same target audio stimuli, comprising monosyllables whose F0 contours were modeled after Mandarin Tone 1 and Tone 4, and whose onset was always a bilabial stop. The voice onset time of the bilabial stop and the onset F0 of the nucleus were manipulated orthogonally. The production results suggest that post-stop F0 following aspirated/voiceless stops was higher than that following unaspirated/voiced stops in both Mandarin and English production. However, the F0 difference in English was larger as compared to Mandarin, indicating that participants assigned more production weight to post-stop F0 in English than in Mandarin. On the perception side, participants used post-stop F0 as a cue in perceiving stops in both English and Mandarin, with higher post-stop F0 leading to more aspirated/voiceless responses, but they allocated more weight to post-stop F0 when interpreting audio stimuli as English words than as Mandarin words. Overall, these results argue for a dual function of F0 in cueing phonological voicing in stops and lexical tone across production and perception in Mandarin. Furthermore, they suggest that bilinguals are able to dynamically adjust even a secondary cue according to different language contexts.												0	0											SEP 26	2022	7								864127	10.3389/fcomm.2022.864127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2022.864127												2026-01-16	WOS:000872786700001

This study aimed to use auditory event-related potentials to explore the mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, negative wave (Nc), and late discriminative negativity (LDN) components in children with and without hearing loss. Method: Nineteen children with normal hearing (CNH) and 17 children with hearing loss (CHL) participated in this study. Two sets of pure tones (1 kHz vs. 1.1 kHz) and lexical tones (/ba2/ vs. /ba4/) were used to examine the auditory discrimination process. Results: MMN could be elicited by the pure tone and the lexical tone in both groups. The MMN latency elicited by nonspeech and speech was later in CHL than in CNH. Additionally, the MMN latency induced by speech occurred later in the left than in the right hemisphere in CNH, and the MMN amplitude elicited by speech in CHL produced a discriminative deficiency compared with that in CNH. Although the P3a latency and amplitude elicited by nonspeech in CHL and CNH were not significantly different, the Nc amplitude elicited by speech performed much lower in CHL than in CNH. Furthermore, the LDN latency elicited by nonspeech was later in CHL than in CNH, and the LDN amplitude induced by speech showed higher dominance in the right hemisphere in both CNH and CHL. Conclusion: By incorporating nonspeech and speech auditory conditions, we propose using MMN, Nc, and LDN as potential indices to investigate auditory perception, memory, and discrimination.												0	1											OCT	2022	65	10					3981	3995		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-22-00008												2026-01-16	WOS:000895300600001
J	Rong, YC; Weng, Y; Chen, F; Peng, G				Rong, Yicheng; Weng, Yi; Chen, Fei; Peng, Gang			Categorical perception of Mandarin lexical tones in language-delayed autistic children	AUTISM				Article								Enhanced pitch perception has been identified in autistic individuals, but it remains understudied whether such enhancement can be observed in the lexical tone perception of language-delayed autistic children. This study examined the categorical perception of Mandarin lexical tones in 23 language-delayed autistic children and two groups of non-autistic children, with one matched on chronological age (n = 23) and the other on developmental age in language ability (n = 23). The participants were required to identify and discriminate lexical tones. A wider identification boundary width and a lower between-category discrimination accuracy were found in autistic children than their chronological-age-matched non-autistic peers, but the autistic group exhibited seemingly comparable performance to the group of developmental-age-matched non-autistic children. While both non-autistic groups displayed a typical categorical perception pattern with enhanced sensitivity to between-category tone pairs relative to within-category ones, such a categorical perception pattern was not observed in the autistic group. These findings suggest among language-delayed autistic children with a developmental age around 4, categorical perception is still developing. Finally, we found categorical perception performance correlated with language ability, indicating autistic children's language disability might be predictive of their poor categorical perception of speech sounds. Lay abstract Some theories suggested that autistic people have better pitch perception skills than non-autistic people. However, in a context where pitch patterns are used to differentiate word meanings (i.e. lexical tones), autistic people may encounter difficulties, especially those with less language experience. We tested this by asking language-delayed autistic children to identify and discriminate two Mandarin lexical tones (/yi/ with Tone 1, meaning 'clothes'; /yi/ with Tone 2, meaning 'aunt'; /yi/: the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese). On average, these autistic children were 7.35 years old, but their developmental age in language ability was 4.20, lagging behind 7-year-old non-autistic children in terms of language ability. Autistic children's performance in identifying and discriminating lexical tones was compared with two groups of non-autistic children: one group was matched with the autistic group on age, and the other was matched based on language ability. Autistic children performed differently from the non-autistic children matched on age, while autistic and non-autistic children matched on language ability exhibited seemingly similar performance. However, both the non-autistic groups have developed the perceptual ability to process lexical tones as different categories, but this ability was still developing in autistic children. Finally, we found autistic children who performed worse in identifying lexical tones had poorer language ability. The results suggest that language disability might have adverse influence on the development of skills of speech sound processing.												9	9											JUL	2023	27	5					1426	1437		10.1177/13623613221138687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13623613221138687		NOV 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000890008200001

However, the duration reflexes of these tones, which hold theoretical significance, and their potential variations between the older generation, who use Taiwanese Southern Min as a first language, and the younger generation, who use it as a "heritage" or second language, have received comparatively less attention. In a sizable corpus study, we demonstrated that Taiwanese Southern Min syllables are best described as bimoraic, akin to other Chinese dialects, where syllables with fewer segments have comparable durations to those with more segments, and vowel durations in simpler syllable structures are longer than those in more complex structures. Furthermore, lexical tone durations partially follow patterns observed cross-linguistically, with rising tones produced longer than falling tones, and tones with higher Fo produced shorter than those with lower Fo. Finally, we observed a much narrower tonal space in young speakers compared to old speakers, with less separation in their F trajectories in both level and contour tone productions. Our comprehensive study delves into underexplored Taiwanese Southern Min tonal duration reflexes, shedding light on potential generational variations and contributing to a better understanding of sound change trajectories.												0	0											MAY 22	2025	51	1					1	31		10.1075/consl.23048.lin	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/consl.23048.lin												2026-01-16	WOS:001494375800004

A comparison of Cantonese and French	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Most languages of the world use lexical tones to contrast words. Thus, understanding how individuals process tones when learning new words is fundamental for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying word learning. The current study asked how tonal information is integrated during word learning. We investigated whether variability in tonal information during learning can interfere with the learning of new words and whether this is language and age dependent. Cantonese- and French -learning 30month -olds (N = 97) and Cantonese- and French-speaking adults (N = 50) were tested with an eye -tracking task on their ability to learn phonetically different pairs of novel words in two learning conditions: a 1 -tone condition in which each object was named with a single label and a 3 -tone condition in which each object was named with three different labels varying in tone. We predicted learning in all groups in the 1 -tone condition. For the 3tone condition, because tones are part of the phonological system of Cantonese but not of French, we expected the Cantonese groups to either fail (toddlers) or show lower performance than in the 1tone condition (adults), whereas the French groups might show less sensitivity to this manipulation. The results show that all participants learned in the 1 -tone condition and were sensitive to tone variation to some extent. Learning in the 3 -tone condition was impeded in both groups of toddlers. We argue that tonal interference in word learning likely comes from the phonological level in the Cantonese groups and from the acoustic level in the French groups. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

To investigate whether Mandarin speakers employ duration contrast to differentiate fake Mandarin geminates and corresponding singletons as well as the underlying pattern of the processing, two auditory oddball tasks were carried out to measure the component of MMN, an index of the automatic detection of deviant stimulus. Mandarin pseudoword pairs which differ only in the duration of the medial consonant ([an1 an1] similar to [an1 nan1] vs. [an2 an2] similar to [an2 nan2]) were used as stimuli. An asymmetric pattern of brain activation was observed where the singleton deviant in the context of geminate words elicited higher MMNs than in the reversed condition. These findings are in line with earlier research suggesting that the singleton is unspecified for a moraic representation, while the geminate is specified. Mandarin speakers can employ duration contrast to distinguish fake geminates and corresponding singletons; furthermore, the processing of fake concatenated geminates in contrast to singletons is similar to that of real geminates and corresponding singletons.												5	5											DEC 10	2021	163								108063	10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.108063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.108063		OCT 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000712079500003

Such studies have shown using behavioural methods that a short distributional training can induce perceptual learning of vowel and consonant contrasts. However, much less is known about the neurological correlates of DL, and few studies have examined non-native lexical tone contrasts. Here, Australian-English speakers underwent DL training on a Mandarin tone contrast using behavioural (discrimination, identification) and neural (oddball-EEG) tasks, with listeners hearing either a bimodal or a unimodal distribution. Behavioural results show that listeners learned to discriminate tones after both unimodal and bimodal training; while EEG responses revealed more learning for listeners exposed to the bimodal distribution. Thus, perceptual learning through exposure to brief sound distributions (a) extends to non-native tonal contrasts, and (b) is sensitive to task, phonetic distance, and acoustic cue-weighting. Our findings have implications for models of how auditory and phonetic constraints influence speech learning.												6	7											MAY	2022	12	5							559	10.3390/brainsci12050559	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12050559												2026-01-16	WOS:000803150800001
J	Qin, Z; Lee-Kim, SI; Qi, HF				Qin, Zhen; Lee-Kim, Sang-Im; Qi, Haifeng			The effect of second-language learning experience on Korean listeners' use of pitch cues in the perception of Cantonese tones	SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH				Article; Early Access								Past studies have found that the linguistic experience of previously-acquired languages, such as one's native-language (L1) and second-language (L2) learning experience, modulates the perception of novel sounds from a third language (L3). Lexical tone in L3 is a good case for testing the influence of L1 or L2, as listeners with varying language backgrounds may use different pitch cues (pitch contour or height) in tone perception. The present study focuses on L2 learners of Mandarin whose L1 variety is either Seoul Korean (SK), a non-tonal stressless language, or Gyeongsang Korean (GK), a tonal pitch-accent language. Intermediate-to-advanced SK-speaking and GK-speaking L2 learners of Mandarin were recruited as target groups, and naive listeners of respective L1 varieties were recruited as control groups. The participants completed an AX forced-choice tone discrimination task. Four Cantonese tones, one rising tone and three level tones, were used. Contour-level and level-level tonal contrasts were target tone pairs, allowing for testing the primary use of pitch contour and pitch height, respectively. The results showed that the two groups of naive listeners had greater accuracy in discriminating level-level than contour-level tonal contrasts. In contrast, L2 learners, independent of their L1 varieties, showed higher accuracy in discriminating contour-level than level-level tonal contrasts. The L2 learners' perceptual pattern is consistent with Mandarin listeners, as reported in previous work. Taken together, the findings provide evidence for a possible developmental change in which Korean-speaking L2 learners might have a perceptual cue shift from pitch height to pitch contour through their L2 experience in Mandarin. The findings about the role of L2 proficiency in Mandarin further supported the effect of L2 experience on learners' increased use of pitch contour.												3	3											2024 APR 10	2024										10.1177/02676583241244604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02676583241244604		APR 2024										2026-01-16	WOS:001200127300001

L.; Kuo, Wen-Jui			Implicit Target Substitution and Sequencing for Lexical Tone Production in Chinese: An fMRI Study	PLOS ONE				Article								In this study, we examine the neural substrates underlying Tone 3 sandhi and tone sequencing in Mandarin Chinese using fMRI. Tone 3 sandhi is traditionally described as the substitution of Tone 3 with Tone 2 when followed by another Tone 3 (i.e., 33 -> 23). According to current speech production models, target substitution is expected to engage the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Since Tone 3 sandhi is, to some extent, independent of segments, which makes it more similar to singing, right-lateralized activation in this region was predicted. As for tone sequencing, based on studies in sequencing, we expected the involvement of the supplementary motor area. In the experiments, participants were asked to produce twelve four-syllable sequences with the same tone assignment (the repeated sequences) or a different tone assignment (the mixed sequences). We found right-lateralized posterior inferior frontal gyrus activation for the sequence 3333 (Tone 3 sandhi) and left-lateralized activation in the supplementary motor area for the mixed sequences (tone sequencing). We proposed that tones and segments could be processed in parallel in the left and right hemispheres, but their integration, or the product of their integration, is hosted in the left hemisphere.												15	19											JAN 10	2014	9	1							e83126	10.1371/journal.pone.0083126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083126												2026-01-16	WOS:000329868200009
J	Lee, CY; Hung, TH				Lee, Chao-Yang; Hung, Tsun-Hui			Identification of Mandarin tones by English-speaking musicians and nonmusicians	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This study examined Mandarin tone identification by 36 English-speaking musicians and 36 nonmusicians and musical note identification by the musicians. In the Mandarin task, participants were given a brief tutorial on Mandarin tones and identified the tones of the syllable sa produced by 32 speakers. The stimuli included intact syllables and acoustically modified syllables with limited F0 information. Acoustic analyses showed considerable overlap in F0 range among the tones due to the presence of multiple speakers. Despite no prior experience with Mandarin, the musicians identified intact tones at 68% and silent-center tones at 54% correct, both exceeding chance (25%). The musicians also outperformed the nonmusicians, who identified intact tones at 44% and silent-center tones at 36% correct. These results indicate musical training facilitated lexical tone identification, although the facilitation varied as a function of tone and the type of acoustic input. In the music task, the musicians listened to synthesized musical notes of three timbres and identified the notes without a reference pitch. Average identification accuracy was at chance level even when multiple semitone errors were allowed. Since none of the musicians possessed absolute pitch, the role of absolute pitch in Mandarin tone identification remains inconclusive. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.

J	Wang, XD; Wang, M; Chen, L				Wang, Xiao-Dong; Wang, Ming; Chen, Lin			Hemispheric lateralization for early auditory processing of lexical tones: Dependence on pitch level and pitch contour	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								In Mandarin Chinese, a tonal language, pitch level and pitch contour are two dimensions of lexical tones according to their acoustic features (i.e., pitch patterns). A change in pitch level features a step change whereas that in pitch contour features a continuous variation in voice pitch. Currently, relatively little is known about the hemispheric lateralization for the processing of each dimension. To address this issue, we made whole-head electrical recordings of mismatch negativity in native Chinese speakers in response to the contrast of Chinese lexical tones in each dimension. We found that pre-attentive auditory processing of pitch level was obviously lateralized to the right hemisphere whereas there is a tendency for that of pitch contour to be lateralized to the left. We also found that the brain responded faster to pitch level than to pitch contour at a pre-attentive stage. These results indicate that the hemispheric lateralization for early auditory processing of lexical tones depends on the pitch level and pitch contour, and suggest an underlying inter-hemispheric interactive mechanism for the processing.

In this study, we use Mandarin Chinese to investigate the effects of lexicality, tone frequency and markedness. We examined Mandarin speakers' tonal categorization of tokens on all possible tonal continua with one end being a word and the other being a tonotactic gap (i.e., an unattested syllable-tone combination). The results of a forced-choice identification experiment showed a general bias against the gap endpoints, with the noted exception of continua involving T4 (X-51), the most frequent lexical tone. Specifically, when T4 served as the gap endpoint, no obvious bias against it was observed regardless of its lexical status. Moreover, on the T3-T4 continua, there was an apparent bias against T3 (X-214), the tone with the most complex contour, again, regardless of lexicality, suggesting a strong markedness effect. Taken together, the results of this study show the individual effects of lexicality, tone frequency and markedness, as well as their interactions, which contribute to our understanding of tonal categorization in relation to lexical statistics (tone frequency) and phonology (markedness).												0	0											JUL 22	2022	13								836865	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.836865	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.836865												2026-01-16	WOS:000837118500001
J	Garg, S; Hamarneh, G; Sereno, J; Jongman, A; Wang, Y				Garg, Saurabh; Hamarneh, Ghassan; Sereno, Joan; Jongman, Allard; Wang, Yue			Different facial cues for different speech styles in Mandarin tone articulation	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION				Article								Visual facial information, particularly hyperarticulated lip movements in clear speech, has been shown to benefit segmental speech perception. Little research has focused on prosody, such as lexical tone, presumably because production of prosody primarily involves laryngeal activities not necessarily distinguishable through visible articulatory movements. However, there is evidence that head, eyebrow, and lip movements correlate with production of pitch-related variations. One subsequent question is whether such visual cues are linguistically meaningful. In this study, we compare movements of the head, eyebrows and lips associated with plain (conversational) vs. clear speech styles of Mandarin tone articulation to examine the extent to which clear-speech modifications involve signal-based overall exaggerated facial movements or code-based enhancement of linguistically relevant articulatory movements. Applying computer-vision techniques to recorded speech, visible movements of the frontal face were tracked and measured for 20 native Mandarin speakers speaking in two speech styles: plain and clear. Thirty-three head, eyebrow and lip movement features based on distance, time, and kinematics were extracted from each individual tone word. A random forest classifier was used to identify the important features that differentiate the two styles across tones and for each tone. Mixed-effects models were then performed to determine the features that were significantly different between the two styles. Overall, for all the four Mandarin tones, we found longer duration and greater movements of the head, eyebrows, and lips in clear speech than in plain speech. Additionally, across tones, the maximum movement happened relatively earlier in clear than plain speech. Although limited evidence of tone-specific modifications was also observed, the cues involved overlap with signal-based changes. These findings suggest that visual facial tonal modifications for clear speech primarily adopt signal-based general emphatic cues that strengthen signal saliency.												2	2											APR 28	2023	8								1148240	10.3389/fcomm.2023.1148240	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1148240												2026-01-16	WOS:000985969400001
J	Qin, Z; Zhang, CC				Qin, Zhen; Zhang, Caicai			The effect of overnight consolidation in the perceptual learning of non-native tonal contrasts	PLOS ONE				Article								Sleep-mediated overnight consolidation has been found to facilitate perceptual learning by promoting learners' generalization across talkers in their perception of novel segmental categories. Lexical tone is characterized by high variability across talkers, and displays dynamic change over time. For this reason, it remains unclear whether a similar effect of overnight consolidation would be found for perceptual learning of novel tonal contrasts. Thus, this study aims to examine whether overnight consolidation facilitates talker-independent learning of lexical tones in the identification and discrimination of novel Cantonese level tones by Mandarin listeners. Two groups of Mandarin listeners were perceptually trained either in the morning or in the evening. Listeners were trained in a tone identification (ID) task with feedback using stimuli produced by a trained talker. Their post-training changes and generalization to a novel talker were then tested in the ID and AX discrimination tasks using stimuli produced by trained and untrained talkers in three posttests following training: immediately after training, 12-hour delay, and 24-hour delay. While the evening group slept between the first and second posttests, the morning group did not. The accuracy rates in the ID task showed that the evening group showed an improved trend, predicted by their individual sleep time, in identifying the level tones produced by both the trained and untrained talkers; in contrast, the morning group showed a declining trend. The d-prime scores in the AX discrimination task did not show different patterns between the two groups. The finding of sleep-related identification changes over time suggests that overnight consolidation might have facilitated tone learning of stimuli produced by the novel talker and eventually facilitated the formation of a more talker-independent representation of novel tone categories in long-term memory. The results are discussed in light of the features of lexical tones to shed light on the mechanism of phonetic learning.												28	29											DEC 12	2019	14	12							e0221498	10.1371/journal.pone.0221498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221498												2026-01-16	WOS:000534070200004

Recent work into the domain-specificity of pitch processing in both domains appears to suggest pitch processing to be governed by shared neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to explore the domain-specificity of pitch processing by simultaneously presenting pitch contours in speech and music to speakers of a tonal language, and measuring behavioral response and event-related potentials (ERPs). Native speakers of Mandarin were exposed to concurrent pitch contours in melody and speech. Contours in melody emulated those in speech were either congruent or incongruent with the pitch contour of the lexical tone (i.e., rising or falling). Component magnitudes of the N2b and N400 were used as indices of lexical processing. We found that the N2b was modulated by melodic pitch; incongruent item evoked significantly stronger amplitude. There was a trend of N400 to be modulated in the same way. Interestingly, these effects were present only on rising tones. Amplitude and time-course of the N2b and N400 may suggest an interference of melodic pitch contours with both early and late stages of phonological and semantic processing.												10	11											MAR 4	2020	15	3							e0229109	10.1371/journal.pone.0229109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229109												2026-01-16	WOS:000535264000015

The development of the list was conducted in four phases. These are described as four separate studies. All involved Setswana L1 participants living in the urban areas of Gauteng. In Study 1, a 45-pair preliminary list was compiled from dictionaries. During Study 2, eleven L1 speakers' familiarity with each word was determined. Based on these results the list was narrowed down to 20 pairs. Study 3 entailed the validation of pictorial stimuli, which illustrate the target words. Ten different participants took part. Four pairs were not consistently familiar and were removed, resulting in the experimental list of 16 pairs. This list was validated in Study 4 and involved nine typical L1 speakers and five listeners. Word-specific analyses revealed that some words had a negative impact on the results. Six pairs were removed. A final list of 10 pairs rendered results more aligned to the expectation of typical speakers and listeners. Validation should continue to determine applicability in populations from exclusively rural or urban areas.												1	2												2018	38	2					127	135		10.1080/02572117.2018.1463700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02572117.2018.1463700												2026-01-16	WOS:000435706800001
J	Gu, F; Zhang, CC; Hu, A; Zhao, GP				Gu, Feng; Zhang, Caicai; Hu, Axu; Zhao, Guoping			Left hemisphere lateralization for lexical and acoustic pitch processing in Cantonese speakers as revealed by mismatch negativity	NEUROIMAGE				Article								For nontonal language speakers, speech processing is lateralized to the left hemisphere and musical processing is lateralized to the right hemisphere (i.e., function-dependent brain asymmetry). On the other hand, acoustic temporal processing is lateralized to the left hemisphere and spectral/pitch processing is lateralized to the right hemisphere (i.e., acoustic-dependent brain asymmetry). In this study, we examine whether the hemispheric lateralization of lexical pitch and acoustic pitch processing in tonal language speakers is consistent with the patterns of function- and acoustic-dependent brain asymmetry in nontonal language speakers. Pitch contrast in both speech stimuli (syllable /ji/ in Experiment 1) and nonspeech stimuli (harmonic tone in Experiment 1; pure tone in Experiment 2) was presented to native Cantonese speakers in passive oddball paradigms. We found that the mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited by lexical pitch contrast was lateralized to the left hemisphere, which is consistent with the pattern of function-dependent brain asymmetry (i.e., left hemisphere lateralization for speech processing) in nontonal language speakers. However, the MMN elicited by acoustic pitch contrast was also left hemisphere lateralized (harmonic tone in Experiment 1) or showed a tendency for left hemisphere lateralization (pure tone in Experiment 2), which is inconsistent with the pattern of acoustic-dependent brain asymmetry (i.e., right hemisphere lateralization for acoustic pitch processing) in nontonal language speakers. The consistent pattern of function-dependent brain asymmetry and the inconsistent pattern of acoustic-dependent brain asymmetry between tonal and nontonal language speakers can be explained by the hypothesis that the acoustic-dependent brain asymmetry is the consequence of a carryover effect from function-dependent brain asymmetry. Potential evolutionary implication of this hypothesis is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Braun, B; Johnson, EK				Braun, Bettina; Johnson, Elizabeth K.			Question or tone 2? How language experience and linguistic function guide pitch processing	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								How does language experience shape pitch processing? Do speakers of tone languages, which use pitch to signal lexical contrasts (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) attend to pitch movements more closely than speakers of intonation languages (e.g., Dutch)? Contradictory findings have been reported in the literature. In the current study, we hypothesize that listeners should be particularly attentive to any pitch information that signals meaningful information in the native language. This includes pitch movements signaling lexical contrasts (present in tone languages only) as well as postlexical contrasts (present in all languages). Both Mandarin and Dutch listeners performed speeded ABX match to sample tasks on the same sets of nonsense words. As predicted, the same pitch movements were attended to differentially by the two language populations depending on the role that information played in the native language. Mandarin listeners were more attentive than Dutch listeners to pitch movements as these signaled potential lexical contrasts in Mandarin (but not Dutch). Importantly, Dutch listeners were more attentive to pitch movements signaling postlexical information than to pitch movements signaling no meaningful linguistic information. These findings underscore the importance of postlexical information in online speech processing and explain apparent contradictions in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhu, JQ; Chen, XX; Yang, YX				Zhu, Jiaqiang; Chen, Xiaoxiang; Yang, Yuxiao			Effects of Amateur Musical Experience on Categorical Perception of Lexical Tones by Native Chinese Adults: An ERP Study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Music impacting on speech processing is vividly evidenced in most reports involving professional musicians, while the question of whether the facilitative effects of music are limited to experts or may extend to amateurs remains to be resolved. Previous research has suggested that analogous to language experience, musicianship also modulates lexical tone perception but the influence of amateur musical experience in adulthood is poorly understood. Furthermore, little is known about how acoustic information and phonological information of lexical tones are processed by amateur musicians. This study aimed to provide neural evidence of cortical plasticity by examining categorical perception of lexical tones in Chinese adults with amateur musical experience relative to the non-musician counterparts. Fifteen adult Chinese amateur musicians and an equal number of non-musicians participated in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment. Their mismatch negativities (MMNs) to lexical tones from Mandarin Tone 2-Tone 4 continuum and non-speech tone analogs were measured. It was hypothesized that amateur musicians would exhibit different MMNs to their non-musician counterparts in processing two aspects of information in lexical tones. Results showed that the MMN mean amplitude evoked by within-category deviants was significantly larger for amateur musicians than non-musicians regardless of speech or non-speech condition. This implies the strengthened processing of acoustic information by adult amateur musicians without the need of focused attention, as the detection of subtle acoustic nuances of pitch was measurably improved. In addition, the MMN peak latency elicited by across-category deviants was significantly shorter than that by within-category deviants for both groups, indicative of the earlier processing of phonological information than acoustic information of lexical tones at the pre-attentive stage. The results mentioned above suggest that cortical plasticity can still be induced in adulthood, hence non-musicians should be defined more strictly than before. Besides, the current study enlarges the population demonstrating the beneficial effects of musical experience on perceptual and cognitive functions, namely, the effects of enhanced speech processing from music are not confined to a small group of experts but extend to a large population of amateurs.												17	20											MAR 15	2021	12								611189	10.3389/fpsyg.2021.611189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.611189												2026-01-16	WOS:000634102100001

This study investigates this visual effect in combined visual-auditory integration with high- and low-variability speech and examines whether one's prior tonal-language learning experience shapes the strength of this visual effect. Method: Thirty Mandarin-naive listeners, 25 Mandarin second language learners, and 30 native Mandarin listeners participated in a tone identification task in which participants judged whether an auditory tone was rising or falling in pitch. Moving arrows depicted the pitch contours of the auditory tones. A priming paradigm was used with the target auditory tones primed by four multi-modal conditions: no stimuli (A-V-), visual-only stimuli (A-V+), auditory-only stimuli (A+V-), and both auditory and visual stimuli (A+V+). Results: For Mandarin naive listeners, the visual effect in accuracy produced under the cross-modal integration (A+V+ vs. A+V-) was superior to a unimodal approach (A-V+ vs. A-V-), as evidenced by a higher d prime of A+V+ as opposed to A+V-. However, this was not the case in response time. Additionally, the visual effect in accuracy and response time under the unimodal approach only occurred for high-variability speech, not for low-variability speech. Across the three groups of listeners, we found that the less tonal-language learning experience one had, the stronger the visual effect. Conclusion: Our study revealed the visual-auditory advantage and disadvantage of the visual effect and the joint contribution of visual-auditory integration and high-variability speech on facilitating tone perception via the process of speech symbolization and categorization.												5	5											NOV	2022	65	11					4096	4111		10.1044/2022_JSLHR-21-00691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2022_JSLHR-21-00691												2026-01-16	WOS:000891439000006

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the interindividual differences in the learning efficacy are not fully understood. Here we examine the extent to which training-induced neural representations of non-native Mandarin tone categories in English listeners (n = 53) are increasingly similar to those of the native listeners (n = 33) who acquired these categories early in infancy. We assess the extent to which the neural similarities in representational structure between non-native learners and native listeners are robust neuromarkers of interindividual differences in learning success. Using intersubject neural representational similarity (IS-NRS) analysis and predictive modeling on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets, we examined the neural representational mechanisms underlying speech category learning success. Learners' neural representations that were significantly similar to the native listeners emerged in brain regions mediating speech perception following training; the extent of the emerging neural similarities with native listeners significantly predicted the learning speed and outcome in learners. The predictive power of IS-NRS outperformed models with other neural representational measures. Furthermore, neural representations underlying successful learning were multidimensional but cost-efficient in nature. The degree of the emergent native-similar neural representations was closely related to the robustness of neural sensitivity to feedback in the frontostriatal network. These findings provide important insights into the experience-dependent representational neuroplasticity underlying successful speech learning in adulthood and could be leveraged in designing individualized feedback-based training paradigms that maximize learning efficacy.												9	9												2021	2	2					280	307		10.1162/nol_a_00035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/nol_a_00035												2026-01-16	WOS:000911632500005

This study investigated whether adult Chinese-speaking listeners with amusia were still able to learn Thai lexical tones based on stimulus frequency of statistical distribution via distributional learning, despite their degraded lexical tone perception. Method: Following a pretest-training-posttest design, 21 amusics and 23 typical, musically intact listeners were assigned into bimodal and unimodal distribution conditions. Listeners were asked to discriminate minimal pairs of Thai midlevel tone and falling tone superimposed on variable base syllables and uttered by different speakers. The perceptual accuracy for each test session and improvement from pretest to posttest were collected and analyzed between the two groups using generalized mixed-effects models. Results: When discriminating Thai lexical tones, amusics were less accurate than typical listeners. Nonetheless, similarly to control listeners, perceptual gains from pretest to posttest were observed in bimodally rather than unimodally trained amusics, as evidenced by both trained and nontrained test words. Conclusions: Amusics are able to learn lexical tones in a second or foreign context of speech. This extends previous research by showing that amusics' distributional learning of linguistic pitch remains largely preserved despite their degraded pitch processing. It is thus likely that manifestations of amusia in speech could not result from their abnormal statistical learning mechanism. This study meanwhile provides a heuristic approach for future studies to apply this paradigm into amusics' treatment to mitigate their pitch-processing disorder.												5	6											JUL	2023	66	7					2461	2477		10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00572												2026-01-16	WOS:001041295400018
J	Xu, GQ; Zhang, LJ; Shu, H; Wang, XY; Li, P				Xu, Guoqing; Zhang, Linjun; Shu, Hua; Wang, Xiaoyi; Li, Ping			Access to lexical meaning in pitch-flattened Chinese sentences: An fMRI study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Chinese is a tonal language in which variation in pitch is used to distinguish word meanings. Thus, in order to understand a word, listeners have to extract the pitch patterns in addition to its phonemes. Can the correct word meaning still be accessed in sentence contexts if pitch patterns of words are altered? If so, how is this accomplished? The present study attempts to address such questions with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Native speakers of Mandarin Chinese listened to normal and pitch-flattened (monotone) speech inside the scanner. The behavioral results indicated that they rated monotone sentences as intelligible as normal sentences, and performed equally well in a dictation test on the two types of sentences. The fMRI results showed that both types of sentences elicited similar activation in the left insular, middle and inferior temporal gyri, but the monotone sentences elicited greater activation in the left planum temporale (PT) compared with normal sentences. These results demonstrate that lexical meaning can still be accessed in pitch-flattened Chinese sentences, and that this process is realized by automatic recovery of the phonological representations of lexical tones from the altered tonal patterns. Our findings suggest that the details of spoken pitch patterns are not essential for adequate lexical-semantic processing during sentence comprehension even in tonal languages like Mandarin Chinese, given that listeners can automatically use additional neural and cognitive resources to recover distorted tonal patterns in sentences.

J	Wong, PCM; Chandrasekaran, B; Zheng, J				Wong, Patrick C. M.; Chandrasekaran, Bharath; Zheng, Jing			The Derived Allele of ASPM Is Associated with Lexical Tone Perception	PLOS ONE				Article								The ASPM and MCPH1 genes have been implicated in the adaptive evolution of the human brain [Mekel-Bobrov N. et al., 2005. Ongoing adaptive evolution of ASPM, a brain size determinant in homo sapiens. Science 309; Evans P. D. et al., 2005. Microcephalin, a gene regulating brain size, continues to evolve adaptively in humans. Science 309]. Curiously, experimental attempts have failed to connect the implicated SNPs in these genes with higher-level brain functions. These results stand in contrast with a population-level study linking the population frequency of their alleles with the tendency to use lexical tones in a language [Dediu D., Ladd D. R., 2007. Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and microcephalin. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104]. In the present study, we found a significant correlation between the load of the derived alleles of ASPM and tone perception in a group of European Americans who did not speak a tone language. Moreover, preliminary results showed a significant correlation between ASPM load and hemodynamic responses to lexical tones in the auditory cortex, and such correlation remained after phonemic awareness, auditory working memory, and non-verbal IQ were controlled. As in previous studies, no significant correlation between ASPM and cognitive measures were found. MCPH1 did not correlate with any measures. These results suggest that the association between the recently derived allele of ASPM is likely to be specific and is tied to higher level brain functions in the temporal cortex related to human communication.												25	27											APR 17	2012	7	4							e34243	10.1371/journal.pone.0034243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034243												2026-01-16	WOS:000305347400008
J	Wu, Y; Su, HH; Yin, H				Wu, Yao; Su, Henghua; Yin, Hui			Enhancing Mandarin tone acquisition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS				Article								This study investigates the effectiveness of a Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) system designed to enhance Mandarin lexical tone acquisition among second language (L2) learners in a self-directed learning context. Drawing on automated speech recognition (ASR) technology, the CAPT system provides real-time, individualized feedback on tone production accuracy. Elementary-level Mandarin learners at an international university in China were randomly assigned to either an experimental group engaged with the CAPT system or a control group using traditional listen-and-repeat practice. Over a two-week period, participants completed pre- and post-tests evaluating their production of four Mandarin tones at the sentence level. Statistical analyses revealed that the experimental group achieved significant gains in tonal accuracy across all four tones, while the control group showed no notable improvement. Survey data further supported the CAPT system's usability and pedagogical value, with learners demonstrating increased awareness of tone patterns and pronunciation strategies. These findings highlight the efficacy of ASR-based CAPT for supporting tone acquisition in tonal languages like Mandarin, especially in supplementing classroom instruction for pronunciation development. The study addresses the underrepresented research in CAPT for L2 Mandarin learning and introduces an effective tool for L2 Mandarin learners and instructors.												0	0											OCT 6	2025	12	2					286	314		10.1075/ijchl.00040.wu	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/ijchl.00040.wu												2026-01-16	WOS:001589219800004

We extended this line of research to consider whether pronunciation errors in Mandarin Chinese are processed differently when a foreign-accented speaker makes them relative to when a native-accented speaker makes them (a conceptual replication using the materials from Pelzl et al., 2019). We evaluated behavioral judgments, the N400, and late positive component while native speakers listened to native and foreign-accented sentences containing tone and rhyme pronunciation errors. We observed effects that suggested that the participants were prone to detect errors in foreign-accented speech more often in sentences with no critical word deviation but also were less likely to reject critical tone errors produced by the foreign-accented speaker. ERP results showed a main effect of accent on late positive components that suggested a difference in degree for sensitivity to foreign-accented compared to native-accented pronunciation errors rather than a completely different response pattern. We found no effect of accent on N400s, with statistically significant differences between tone and rhyme errors regardless of speaker accent.												4	4											JUN	2021	71	2					414	452		10.1111/lang.12438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12438		OCT 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000579859800001
J	Zhang, CC; Shao, J				Zhang, Caicai; Shao, Jing			Normal pre-attentive and impaired attentive processing of lexical tones in Cantonese-speaking congenital amusics	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				Article								The neural underpinnings of congenital amusia, an innate neurogenetic disorder of musical pitch processing, are not well understood. Previous studies suggest that amusia primarily impairs attentive processing (P300) of small pitch deviations in music, leaving pre-attentive pitch processing (mismatch negativity or MMN) more or less intact. However, it remains unknown whether the same neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficiency underlies pitch processing in speech, where amusics also often show impairment behaviorally. The current study examined how lexical tones are processed in pre-attentive (MMN) and attentive (P300) conditions in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 matched controls. At the pre-attentive level, Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited normal MMN responses to lexical tone changes, even for tone pairs with small pitch differences (mid level vs. low level tone; high rising vs. low rising tone). However, at the attentive level, amusics exhibited reduced P3a amplitude for all tone pairs, and further reduced P3b amplitude for tone pairs with small pitch differences. These results suggest that the amusic brain detects tone changes normally pre-attentively, but shows impairment in consciously detecting the same tone differences. Consistent with previous findings in nonspeech pitch processing, this finding provides support for a domain-general neuro-dynamic mechanism of deficient attentive pitch processing in amusia.												12	12											MAY 30	2018	8								8420	10.1038/s41598-018-26368-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26368-7												2026-01-16	WOS:000433539800018
J	Chang, CB; Bowles, AR				Chang, Charles B.; Bowles, Anita R.			Context effects on second-language learning of tonal contrasts	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Studies of lexical tone learning generally focus on monosyllabic contexts, while reports of phonetic learning benefits associated with input variability are based largely on experienced learners. This study trained inexperienced learners on Mandarin tonal contrasts to test two hypotheses regarding the influence of context and variability on tone learning. The first hypothesis was that increased phonetic variability of tones in disyllabic contexts makes initial tone learning more challenging in disyllabic than monosyllabic words. The second hypothesis was that the learnability of a given tone varies across contexts due to differences in tonal variability. Results of a word learning experiment supported both hypotheses: tones were acquired less successfully in disyllables than in monosyllables, and the relative difficulty of disyllables was closely related to contextual tonal variability. These results indicate limited relevance of monosyllable-based data on Mandarin learning for the disyllabic majority of the Mandarin lexicon. Furthermore, in the short term, variability can diminish learning; its effects are not necessarily beneficial but dependent on acquisition stage and other learner characteristics. These findings thus highlight the importance of considering contextual variability and the interaction between variability and type of learner in the design, interpretation, and application of research on phonetic learning.

J	Prom-on, S; Xu, Y; Thipakorn, B				Prom-on, Santitham; Xu, Yi; Thipakorn, Bundit			Modeling tone and intonation in Mandarin and English as a process of target approximation	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								This paper reports the development of a quantitative target approximation (qTA) model for generating F-0 contours of speech. The qTA model simulates the production of tone and intonation as a process of syllable-synchronized sequential target approximation [Xu, Y. (2005). "Speech melody as articulatorily implemented communicative functions," Speech Commun. 46, 220-251]. It adopts a set of biomechanical and linguistic assumptions about the mechanisms of speech production. The communicative functions directly modeled are lexical tone in Mandarin and lexical stress in English and focus in both languages. The qTA model is evaluated by extracting function-specific model parameters from natural speech via supervised learning (automatic analysis by synthesis) and comparing the F-0 contours generated with the extracted parameters to those of natural utterances through numerical evaluation and perceptual testing. The F-0 contours generated by the qTA model with the learned parameters were very close to the natural contours in terms of root mean square error, rate of human identification of tone, and focus and judgment of naturalness by human listeners. The results demonstrate that the qTA model is both an effective tool for research on tone and intonation and a potentially effective system for automatic synthesis of tone and intonation.												123	137											JAN	2009	125	1					405	424		10.1121/1.3037222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.3037222												2026-01-16	WOS:000262672600051
J	Chui, YT; Qin, QZ				Chui, Yin-To; Qin, Quentin Zhen			Individual differences in the distributional learning and overnight consolidation of the Mandarin level-falling tone contrast	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								In perceptual studies, musicality and pitch aptitude have been implicated in tone learning, while vocabulary size has been implicated in distributional (segment) learning. Moreover, working memory plays a role in the overnight consolidation of explicit-declarative L2 learning. This study examines how these factors uniquely account for individual differences in the distributional learning and consolidation of an L2 tone contrast, where learners are tonal language speakers, and the training is implicit. Following a previous study investigating distributional tone learning, 66 L1-Cantonese participants who learned and consolidated a Mandarin level-falling tone contrast through distributional exposure were measured in a pitch threshold task, Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, Mandarin Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and an Operation Span task. Pitch threshold predicted immediate learning improvement while working memory predicted overnight consolidation by a bimodal group (not a unimodal group). The findings imply that pitch aptitude may be important in encoding stepwise tonal tokens, and the predictive power of working memory in overnight consolidation extends to implicit tone learning. Meanwhile, musical aptitude may not confer an additional advantage for speakers with native-tone experiences, and learners with a larger L2 vocabulary size might have resisted adaptation to distributional exposure because of robust L2 tonal representations.												1	1											DEC	2024	156	6					4256	4268		10.1121/10.0034717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0034717												2026-01-16	WOS:001386141300001
J	Ou, SC; Guo, ZC				Ou, Shu-chen; Guo, Zhe-chen			The differential effects of vowel and onset consonant lengthening on speech segmentation: Evidence from Taiwanese Southern Min	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								A review of previous speech segmentation research suggests the prediction that listeners of Taiwanese Southern Min (TSM), a lexical tone language, would exploit vowel lengthening and syllable-onset consonant lengthening to locate word ends and beginnings, respectively. Yet, correlations between segment duration and tone identity in tone languages along with some TSM-specific phonological phenomena may work against such use. Two artificial language learning experiments examined TSM listeners' use of the lengthening cues. The listeners heard the words of an artificial language (e.g., /ba.nu.me/) repeated continuously and identified them in a subsequent two-alternative forced-choice test. Experiment I revealed that their segmentation benefits from and only from word-initial onset lengthening or word-final vowel lengthening, supporting the prediction. Experiment II further demonstrated that these two cues in combination synergistically support segmentation at least when compared to word-initial onset lengthening alone, consistent with previous findings regarding complementary cues. These results furnish additional evidence that vowel and onset consonant lengthening affect segmentation in different ways, possibly reflecting a functional division between vowels and consonants that is supported by some prosody-computing mechanism. Additionally, vowel lengthening seems to affect segmentation to a greater extent than onset consonant lengthening. Possible explanations for this and further issues are discussed.												3	3											MAR	2021	149	3					1866	1877		10.1121/10.0003751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0003751												2026-01-16	WOS:000629775500004
J	Bosker, HR; Sjerps, MJ; Reinisch, E				Bosker, Hans Rutger; Sjerps, Matthias J.; Reinisch, Eva			Spectral contrast effects are modulated by selective attention in "cocktail party" settings	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								Speech sounds are perceived relative to spectral properties of surrounding speech. For instance, target words that are ambiguous between /b?t/ (with low F1) and /bet/ (with high F1) are more likely to be perceived as "bet" after a "low F1" sentence, but as "bit" after a "high F1" sentence. However, it is unclear how these spectral contrast effects (SCEs) operate in multi-talker listening conditions. Recently, Feng and Oxenham (J.Exp.Psychol.-Hum.Percept.Perform. 44(9), 1447-1457,2018b) reported that selective attention affected SCEs to a small degree, using two simultaneously presented sentences produced by a single talker. The present study assessed the role of selective attention in more naturalistic "cocktail party" settings, with 200 lexically unique sentences, 20 target words, and different talkers. Results indicate that selective attention to one talker in one ear (while ignoring another talker in the other ear) modulates SCEs in such a way that only the spectral properties of the attended talker influences target perception. However, SCEs were much smaller in multi-talker settings (Experiment2) than those in single-talker settings (Experiment1). Therefore, the influence of SCEs on speech comprehension in more naturalistic settings (i.e., with competing talkers) may be smaller than estimated based on studies without competing talkers.												14	14											JUN	2020	82	3					1318	1332		10.3758/s13414-019-01824-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-019-01824-2												2026-01-16	WOS:000541113500032

Pitch has a lower functional load and shows a simpler pattern in Turkish than in Chinese as the former only contrasts between presence and the absence of pitch elevation, while the latter makes use of four different pitch contours lexically. Using the Musical Ear Test as the tool, we found that the Chinese listeners outperformed the Turkish listeners, and the advanced L2 learners outperformed the beginning learners. The Turkish listeners were further tested on their discrimination of bisyllabic Chinese lexical tones, and again an L2 advantage was observed. No significant difference was found for working memory between the beginning and advanced L2 learners. These results suggest that richness of tonal inventory of the native language is essential for triggering a music processing advantage, and on top of the tone language advantage, the L2 experience yields a further enhancement. Yet, unlike the tone language advantage that seems to relate to pitch expertise, learning an L2 seems to improve sound discrimination in general, and such improvement exhibits in non-native lexical tone discrimination.												2	3											MAR 23	2023	13	2					218	237		10.1075/lab.20030.che	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/lab.20030.che		JUL 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000722914200001

Repetition Suppression in the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus Predicts Tone Learning Performance	CEREBRAL CORTEX				Article								Do individuals differ in how efficiently they process non-native sounds? To what extent do these differences relate to individual variability in sound-learning aptitude? We addressed these questions by assessing the sound-learning abilities of Dutch native speakers as they were trained on non-native tone contrasts. We used fMRI repetition suppression to the non-native tones to measure participants' neuronal processing efficiency before and after training. Although all participants improved in tone identification with training, there was large individual variability in learning performance. A repetition suppression effect to tone was found in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFGs) before training. No whole-brain effect was found after training; a region-of-interest analysis, however, showed that, after training, repetition suppression to tone in the left IFG correlated positively with learning. That is, individuals who were better in learning the non-native tones showed larger repetition suppression in this area. Crucially, this was true even before training. These findings add to existing evidence that the left IFG plays an important role in sound learning and indicate that individual differences in learning aptitude stem from differences in the neuronal efficiency with which non-native sounds are processed.												17	19											JUN	2016	26	6					2728	2742		10.1093/cercor/bhv126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhv126												2026-01-16	WOS:000377917500030

Using the dichotic listening technique, the study investigates the hemispheric processing of Japanese pitch accent by native Japanese listeners and two groups of nonnative listeners with no prior pitch accent experience but differing in their native language experience with linguistic pitch: native listeners of Mandarin (a tone language with higher linguistic functional use of pitch) and native listeners of English (a stress language with lower functional use of pitch). The overall results reveal that, for both native and nonnative listeners, the processing of Japanese pitch accent is less lateralized (compared to lexical tone processing, which has been found to be a left hemisphere property). However, detailed analysis with individual pitch accents across groups shows a right hemisphere preference for processing the high-accent-low (H*L) pattern, a left hemisphere preference for LH*, and no hemisphere dominance for LH, indicating a significant reliance on the acoustic cues. These patterns are particularly prominent with the English listeners who are least experienced with linguistic pitch. Together, the findings suggest an interplay of linguistic and acoustic aspects in the processing of Japanese pitch accent by native and nonnative listeners.												18	20											JUL	2012	33	3					623	641		10.1017/S0142716411000506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0142716411000506												2026-01-16	WOS:000305669100008

MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL				Article								This study examines the putative benefits of explicit phonetic instruction, high variability phonetic training, and their effects on adult nonnative speakers' Mandarin tone productions. Monolingual first language (L1) English speakers (n = 80), intermediate second language (L2) Mandarin learners (n = 40), and L1 Mandarin speakers (n = 40) took part in a multiday Mandarin-like artificial language learning task. Participants were asked to repeat a syllable-tone combination immediately after hearing it. Half of all participants were exposed to speech from 1 talker (low variability) while the other half heard speech from 4 talkers (high variability). Half of the L1 English participants were given daily explicit instruction on Mandarin tone contours, while the other half were not. Tone accuracy was measured by L1 Mandarin raters (n = 104) who classified productions according to their perceived tonal category. Explicit instruction of tone contours facilitated L1 English participants' production of rising and falling tone contours. High variability input alone had no main effect on participants' productions but interacted with explicit instruction to improve participants' productions of high-level tone contours. These results motivate an L2 tone production training approach that consists of explicit tone instruction followed by gradual exposure to more variable speech.												49	56											MAR	2020	104	1					152	168		10.1111/modl.12619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/modl.12619		JAN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000509113900001

This study contributes to the debate by investigating auditory inhibitory control in English-speaking monolingual musicians, non-musicians, tone language bilinguals, and non-tone language bilinguals. We predicted that musicians and tone language bilinguals would demonstrate enhanced processing relative to monolinguals and other bilinguals. Groups of monolinguals (N = 22), monolingual musicians (N = 19), non-tone language bilinguals (N = 20) and tone language bilinguals (N = 18) were compared on auditory Stroop tasks to assess domain-transferable processing benefits (e.g. auditory inhibitory control) resulting from potentially shared underlying cognitive mechanisms (Patel, 2003; Bialystok & DePape, 2009). In one task, participants heard the words "high" and "low" presented in high or low pitches, and responded regarding the pitch of the stimuli as quickly as possible. In another task, participants heard the words "rise" or "fall" presented in rising or falling pitch contours, and responded regarding the contour of the stimuli as quickly as possible. Results suggest transferable auditory inhibitory control benefits for musicians across pitch and contour processing, but any possible enhanced processing for speakers of tone languages may be task-dependent, as lexical tone activation may interfere with pitch contour processing.												0	0												2018	18	1-2					104	123		10.1163/15685373-12340022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685373-12340022												2026-01-16	WOS:000431048200006
J	WHALEN, DH; XU, Y				WHALEN, DH; XU, Y			INFORMATION FOR MANDARINE TONES IN THE AMPLITUDE CONTOUR AND IN BRIEF SEGMENTS	PHONETICA				Article								While the tones of Mandarin are conveyed mainly by the F0 contour, they also differ consistently in duration and in amplitude contour. The contribution of these factors was examined by using signal-correlated noise stimuli, in which natural speech is manipulated so that it has no F0 or formant structure but retains its original amplitude contour and duration. Tones 2, 3 and 4 were perceptible from just the amplitude contour, even when duration was not also a cue. In two further experiments, the location of the critical information for the tones during the course of the syllable was examined by extracting small segments from each part of the original syllable. Tones 2 and 3 were often confused with each other, and segments which did not have much F0 change were most often heard as Tone 1. There were, though, also cases in which a low, unchanging pitch was heard as Tone 3, indicating a partial effect of register even in Mandarin. F0 was positively correlated with amplitude, even when both were computed on a pitch period basis. Taken together, the results show that Mandarin tones are realized in more than just the F0 pattern, that amplitude contours can be used b listeners as cues for tone identification, and that not every portion of the F0 pattern unambiguously indicates the original tone.												250	303												1992	49	1					25	47		10.1159/000261901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000261901												2026-01-16	WOS:A1992HV04900002

The aim of this study was to explore second language (L2) production of Cantonese tones by advanced learners whose first language (L1) is Mandarin. Forty-one informants participated in a recording experiment to provide production data of Cantonese tones. The speech data were measured acoustically using the computer software Praat (Version 6.3.10) and were evaluated perceptually by native Cantonese speakers. The relationship between the acoustic analysis and perceptual evaluation was also explored. The acoustic and perceptual evaluations confirmed that, while the tones that the Mandarin learners of Cantonese produced were non-native-like, their production of the Cantonese T1 and T2 was good in general. Furthermore, the accuracy of the perceptual evaluations could be predicted based on the acoustic features of the L2 tones. Our findings are in line with hypotheses in current speech learning models, and demonstrate that familiar phonetic categories are easier to acquire than are unfamiliar ones. To provide a more complete picture of L2 speech acquisition, future research should investigate L2 tone acquisition using both production and perception data obtained from participants with a greater variety of L1s.												0	0											JUN 11	2025	15	12							6590	10.3390/app15126590	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app15126590												2026-01-16	WOS:001515186800001
J	Deutsch, D; Henthorn, T				Deutsch, D; Henthorn, T			Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework	MUSIC PERCEPTION				Article								Absolute pitch is generally considered to reflect a rare musical endowment; however, its characteristics are puzzling and its genesis is unclear. We describe two experiments in which native speakers of tone languages-Mandarin and Vietnamese-were found to display a remarkably precise and stable form of absolute pitch in enunciating words. We further describe a third experiment in which speakers of English displayed less stability on an analogous task. Based on these findings, and considering the related literatures on critical periods in speech development, and the neurological underpinnings of lexical tone, we propose a framework for the genesis of absolute pitch. The framework assumes that absolute pitch originally evolved as a feature of speech, analogous to other features such as vowel quality, and that speakers of tone language naturally acquire this feature during the critical period for speech acquisition. We further propose that the acquisition of absolute pitch by rare individuals who speak an intonation language may be associated with a critical period of unusually long duration, so that it encompasses the age at which the child can take music lessons. We conclude that the potential to acquire absolute pitch is universally present at birth, and that it can be realized by enabling the infant to associate pitches with verbal labels during the critical period for speech acquisition.												115	148											SPR	2004	21	3					339	356		10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339												2026-01-16	WOS:000220273000005

However, it is unclear whether musical training provides an advantage in recognizing segmental and suprasegmental infor-mation of spoken language. We used vowel and tone violations in spoken unfamiliar seven-character quatrains and a rhyming judgment task to investigate the effects of musical training on tone and vowel processing by recording ERPs. Compared with non-musicians, musicians were more accurate and responded faster to incorrect than correct tones. Musicians showed larger P2 components in their ERPs than non-musicians during both tone and vowel processing, revealing increased focused attention on sounds. Both groups showed enhanced N400 and LPC for incorrect vowels (vs. correct vowels) but non-musicians showed an additional P2 effect for vowel vio-lations. Moreover, both groups showed enhanced LPC for incorrect tones (vs. correct tones) but only non -musicians showed an additional N400 effect for tone violations. These results indicate that vowel/tone pro-cessing is less effortful for musicians (vs. non-musicians). Our study suggests that long-term musical training facilitates speech tone and vowel processing in a tonal language environment by increasing the attentional focus on speech and reducing demands for detecting incorrect vowels and integration costs for tone changes.												6	6											MAR	2023	166								105952	10.1016/j.bandc.2023.105952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandc.2023.105952		JAN 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000921079600001
J	Zheng, TT; Levelt, CC; Chen, YY				Zheng, Tingting; Levelt, Clara C.; Chen, Yiya			The affective iconicity of lexical tone: Evidence from standard Chinesea)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Previous studies suggested that pitch characteristics of lexical tones in Standard Chinese influence various sensory perceptions, but whether they iconically bias emotional experience remained unclear. We analyzed the arousal and valence ratings of bi-syllabic words in two corpora (Study 1) and conducted an affect rating experiment using a carefully designed corpus of bi-syllabic words (Study 2). Two-alternative forced-choice tasks further tested the robustness of lexical tones' affective iconicity in an auditory nonce word context (Study 3). Hierarchical linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and cross-validation were employed to understand the relationship between lexical tones and the emotional responses of tone-carrying words. Results consistently indicated that words with a falling-falling tonal sequence, both real and nonce words, received higher arousal ratings than those with rising-rising and rising-low tones. Only in nonce words, the high-high sequence was more likely to be associated with the low-arousal option; the falling-falling tone sequence was more often linked to negative-valence choice, while high-high and rising-rising tones with positive-valence. These findings, though subtle, suggest that the use of pitch in lexical tones influences emotional responses during the processing of tone-carrying words, pointing to an inherent iconic quality in lexical tones that may subtly shape speakers' emotional experiences.												2	2											JAN	2025	157	1					396	408		10.1121/10.0034863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0034863												2026-01-16	WOS:001405930900002

Multi-level processing of phonetic variants in speech production and visual word processing: evidence from Mandarin lexical tones	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Two picture-word interference experiments provide new evidence on the nature of phonological processing in speech production and visual word processing. In both experiments, responses were significantly faster either when distractor and target matched in tone category, but had different overt realisations (toneme condition) or when target and distractor matched in overt realisation, but mismatched in tone category (contour condition). Tone 3 sandhi is an allophone of Beijing Mandarin Tone 3 (T3). Its contour is similar to another tone, Tone 2. In Experiment 1, sandhi picture naming was faster with contour (Tone 2) and toneme (low Tone 3) distractors, compared to control distractors. This indicates both category and context-specific representations are activated in sandhi word production. In Experiment 2, both contour (Tone 2) and toneme (low Tone 3) picture naming was facilitated by visually presented sandhi distractors, compared to controls, evidence that category and context-specific instantiated representations are automatically activated during processing of visually presented words. Combined, the results point to multi-level processing of phonology, whether words are overtly produced or processed visually. Interestingly, there were differences in the time course of effects.												28	29											MAY 28	2015	30	5					491	505		10.1080/23273798.2014.942326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2014.942326												2026-01-16	WOS:000350811000001

By using a MEG experiment of magnetic mismatch negativity (MMN)/magnetic mismatch field (MMNm) paradigm, the present study examined the brain wave patterns of beginning learners of learning Chinese as a second language (CSL), who enrolled in a short term digital learning program, and were found to have improved sensitivity in discrimination for lexical tones by developing a left lateralized dominance for processing Chinese lexical tones, just like native Mandarin speakers. In the experiment, the measurements of MMNm, with the contrast between large deviant T3/T1 and between small deviant T3/T2, were computed to index the changed patterns of brain processing before and after learning. Results of the MMNm data indicated that activation for large deviant contrast T3/T1 elicited earlier and significantly larger MMN than that of the small deviant contrast T3/T2, which is in line with previous studies done on native Chinese speakers. More importantly, in the comparison of pre-test and post-test time course, the amplitude of MMNm showed a significant increase in the left hemisphere after learning. The evidence indicated clearly a learning effect in the perception of linguistic features and a left lateralized neural network of processing Mandarin lexical tones. Moreover, in the source analysis, the left lateralized patterns of prefrontal generator (i.e., insula) and generator of auditory cortex (i.e., Heschl's Gyrus) changed after learning, which is also consistent with the native Mandarin speaker's response patterns. In sum, the present study provides neural evidence for a functional reorganization in the brains of second language learners, transforming the CSL learners to behave like native speakers in the perception of lexical tones even after just a short-term and non-specific training program.

Syllabic tone articulation influences the identification and use of words during Chinese sentence reading: Evidence from ERP and eye movement recordings	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE				Article								In two experiments, we examined the contribution of articulation-specific features to visual word recognition during the reading of Chinese. In spoken Standard Chinese, a syllable with a full tone can be tone-neutralized through sound weakening and pitch contour change, and there are two types of two-character compound words with respect to their articulation variation. One type requires articulation of a full tone for each constituent character, and the other requires a full- and a neutral-tone articulation for the first and second characters, respectively. Words of these two types with identical first characters were selected and embedded in sentences. Native speakers of Standard Chinese were recruited to read the sentences. In Experiment 1, the individual words of a sentence were presented serially at a fixed pace while event-related potentials were recorded. This resulted in less-negative N100 and anterior N250 amplitudes and in more-negative N400 amplitudes when targets contained a neutral tone. Complete sentences were visible in Experiment 2, and eye movements were recorded while participants read. Analyses of oculomotor activity revealed shorter viewing durations and fewer refixations on-and fewer regressive saccades to-target words when their second syllable was articulated with a neutral rather than a full tone. Together, the results indicate that readers represent articulation-specific word properties, that these representations are routinely activated early during the silent reading of Chinese sentences, and that the representations are also used during later stages of word processing.												10	10											FEB	2016	16	1					72	92		10.3758/s13415-015-0368-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13415-015-0368-1												2026-01-16	WOS:000370842100007
J	Tsai, CG; Chou, TL; Li, CW				Tsai, Chen-Gia; Chou, Tai-Li; Li, Chia-Wei			Roles of posterior parietal and dorsal premotor cortices in relative pitch processing: Comparing musical intervals to lexical tones	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								Humans use time-varying pitch patterns to convey information in music and speech. Recognition of musical melodies and lexical tones relies on relative pitch (RP), the ability to identify intervals between two pitches. RP processing in music is usually more fine-grained than that in tonal languages. In Western music, there are twelve pitch categories within an octave, whereas there are only three level (non-glide) lexical tones in Taiwanese (or Taiwanese Hokkien, a tonal language). The present study aimed at comparing the neural substrates underlying RP processing of musical melodic intervals with that of level lexical tones in Taiwanese. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data from fourteen participants with good RP were analyzed. The results showed that imagining the sounds of visually presented musical intervals was associated with enhanced activity in the central subregion of the right dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and right dorsal precuneus compared to auditory imagery of visually presented Taiwanese bi-character words with level lexical tones. During the sound-congruence-judgement task (auditory imagery of musical intervals or bi-character words, and subsequently judging if the imagined sounds were melodically congruent with heard sounds), the contrast of the musical minus linguistic conditions yielded activity in the bilateral dPMC-PPC network and dorsal precuneus, with the dPMC activated in the rostral subregion. The central dPMC and PPC may mediate the attention-based maintenance of pitch intervals, whereas the dorsal precuneus may support attention control and the spatial/sensorimotor processing of the fine-grained pitch structures of music. When judging the congruence between the imagined and heard musical intervals, the bilateral rostral dPMC may play a role in attention control, working memory, evaluation of motor activities, and monitoring mechanisms. Based on the findings of this study and recent studies of amusia, we suggest that higher order cognitive operations are critical to the more fine-grained pitch processing of musical melodies compared to lexical tones.												7	9											OCT	2018	119						118	127		10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.07.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.07.028												2026-01-16	WOS:000450543800012
J	Wiener, S; Lee, CY				Wiener, Seth; Lee, Chao-Yang			Multi-Talker Speech Promotes Greater Knowledge-Based Spoken Mandarin Word Recognition in First and Second Language Listeners	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Spoken word recognition involves a perceptual tradeoff between the reliance on the incoming acoustic signal and knowledge about likely sound categories and their co-occurrences as words. This study examined how adult second language (L2) learners navigate between acoustic-based and knowledge-based spoken word recognition when listening to highly variable, multi-talker truncated speech, and whether this perceptual tradeoff changes as L2 listeners gradually become more proficient in their L2 after multiple months of structured classroom learning. First language (L1) Mandarin Chinese listeners and L1 English-L2 Mandarin adult listeners took part in a gating experiment. The L2 listeners were tested twice - once at the start of their intermediate/advanced L2 language class and again 2 months later. L1 listeners were only tested once. Participants were asked to identify syllable-tone words that varied in syllable token frequency (high/low according to a spoken word corpus) and syllable-conditioned tonal probability (most probable/least probable in speech given the syllable). The stimuli were recorded by 16 different talkers and presented at eight gates ranging from onset-only (gate 1) through onset +40 ms increments (gates 2 through 7) to the full word (gate 8). Mixed-effects regression modeling was used to compare performance to our previous study which used single-talker stimuli (Wiener et al., 2019). The results indicated that multi-talker speech caused both L1 and L2 listeners to rely greater on knowledge-based processing of tone. L1 listeners were able to draw on distributional knowledge of syllable-tone probabilities in early gates and switch to predominantly acoustic-based processing when more of the signal was available. In contrast, L2 listeners, with their limited experience with talker range normalization, were less able to effectively transition from probability-based to acoustic-based processing. Moreover, for the L2 listeners, the reliance on such distributional information for spoken word recognition appeared to be conditioned by the nature of the acoustic signal. Single-talker speech did not result in the same pattern of probability-based tone processing, suggesting that knowledge-based processing of L2 speech may only occur under certain acoustic conditions, such as multi-talker speech.												19	20											FEB 20	2020	11								214	10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00214	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00214												2026-01-16	WOS:000525240000001
J	Guo, ZC; Ou, SC				Guo, Zhe-Chen; Ou, Shu-Chen			The use of tonal coarticulation in segmentation of artificial language speech: A study with Mandarin listeners	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS				Article								Tonal carryover assimilation, whereby a tone is assimilated to the preceding one, is conditioned by prosodic boundaries in a way suggesting that its presence may signal continuity or lack of a boundary. Its possibility as a speech segmentation cue was investigated in two artificial language (AL) learning experiments. Mandarin-speaking listeners identified the "words" of a three-tone AL (e.g., [pe.ti.ku]) after listening to six long speech streams in which the words were repeated continuously without pauses. The first experiment revealed that segmentation was disrupted in an "incongruent-cues" condition where tonal carryover assimilation occurred across AL word boundaries and conflicted with statistical regularities in the speech streams. Segmentation was neither facilitated nor inhibited in a "congruent-cues" condition where tonal carryover assimilation occurred only within the AL words in 27% of the repetitions and never across word boundaries. A null effect was again found for the congruent-cues condition of the second experiment, where all AL word repetitions carried tonal carryover assimilation. These findings show that tonal carryover assimilation is exploited to resolve segmentation problems when cues conflict. Its null effect in the congruent-cues conditions might be linked to cue redundancy and suggest that it is weighted low in the segmentation cue hierarchy.												0	0											MAY	2021	42	3					631	655	PII S0142716420000818	10.1017/S0142716420000818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0142716420000818												2026-01-16	WOS:000644869700004

At an early stage, or a preattentive stage, the right brain hemisphere is shown to dominate the auditory processing of tones, including lexical tones. However, little is known about the influence of brain damage on the labor division of the brain hemispheres for the auditory processing of linguistic tones. Here, we demonstrate swapped dominance of brain hemispheres at the preattentive stage of auditory processing of Chinese lexical tones after a stroke in the right temporal lobe (RTL). In this study, we frequently presented lexical tones to a group of patients with a stroke in the RTL and infrequently varied the tones to create an auditory contrast. The contrast evoked a mismatch negativity response, which indexes auditory processing at the preattentive stage. In the participants with a stroke in the RTL, the mismatch negativity response was lateralized to the left side, in contrast to the right lateralization pattern in the control participants. The swapped dominance of brain hemispheres indicates that the RTL is a core area for early-stage auditory tonal processing. Our study indicates the necessity of rehabilitating tonal processing functions for tonal language speakers who suffer an RTL injury.												3	3											AUG 26	2022	16								909796	10.3389/fnins.2022.909796	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.909796												2026-01-16	WOS:000882995400001
J	Prom-on, S; Liu, F; Xu, Y				Prom-on, Santitham; Liu, Fang; Xu, Yi			Post-low bouncing in Mandarin Chinese: Acoustic analysis and computational modeling	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Post-low bouncing is a phenomenon whereby after reaching a very low pitch in a low lexical tone, F-0 bounces up and then gradually drops back in the following syllables. This paper reports the results of an acoustic analysis of the phenomenon in two Mandarin Chinese corpora and presents a simple mechanical model that can effectively simulate this bouncing effect. The acoustic analysis shows that most of the F-0 dynamic features profiling the bouncing effect strongly correlate with the amount of F-0 lowering in the preceding low-tone syllable, and that the additional F-0 raising commences at the onset of the first post-low syllable. Using the quantitative Target Approximation model, this bouncing effect was simulated by adding an acceleration adjustment to the initial F-0 state of the first post-low syllable. A highly linear relation between F-0 lowering and estimated acceleration adjustment was found. This relation was then used to effectively simulate the bouncing effect in both the neutral tone and the full tones. The results of the analysis and simulation are consistent with the hypothesis that the bouncing effect is due to a temporary perturbation of the balance between antagonistic forces in the laryngeal control in producing a very low pitch.

These relationships are referred to as the abstract auditory rule in speech and have been investigated for their underlying neural mechanisms at an attentive stage. However, the issue of whether or not there is a sensory intelligence that enables one to automatically encode abstract auditory rules in speech at a preattentive stage has not yet been thoroughly addressed. Methodology/ Principal Findings: We chose Chinese lexical tones for the current study because they help to define word meaning and hence facilitate the fabrication of an abstract auditory rule in a speech sound stream. We continuously presented native Chinese speakers with Chinese vowels differing in formant, intensity, and level of pitch to construct a complex and varying auditory stream. In this stream, most of the sounds shared flat lexical tones to form an embedded abstract auditory rule. Occasionally the rule was randomly violated by those with a rising or falling lexical tone. The results showed that the violation of the abstract auditory rule of lexical tones evoked a robust preattentive auditory response, as revealed by whole-head electrical recordings of the mismatch negativity (MMN), though none of the subjects acquired explicit knowledge of the rule or became aware of the violation. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that there is an auditory sensory intelligence in the perception of Chinese lexical tones. The existence of this intelligence suggests that the humans can automatically extract abstract auditory rules in speech at a preattentive stage to ensure speech communication in complex and noisy auditory environments without drawing on conscious resources.												19	22											JAN 6	2012	7	1							e30027	10.1371/journal.pone.0030027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030027												2026-01-16	WOS:000301188800055

Audio-video recordings of 20 native Mandarin speakers producing Mandarin words involving the vowel /3/ with each of the four tones were analyzed. Four facial points of interest were detected automatically: medial point of left eyebrow, nose tip (proxy for head movement), and midpoints of the upper and lower lips. The detected points were then automatically tracked in the subsequent video frames. Critical features such as the distance, velocity, and acceleration describing local facial movements with respect to the resting face of each speaker were extracted from the positional profiles of each tracked point. Analysis of variance and feature importance analysis based on random forest were performed to examine the significance of each feature for representing each tone and how well these features can individually and collectively characterize each tone. Results suggest alignments between articulatory movements and pitch trajectories, with downward or upward head and eyebrow movements following the dipping and rising tone trajectories respectively, lip closing movement being associated with the falling tone, and minimal movements for the level tone.												14	16											OCT	2019	113						47	62		10.1016/j.specom.2019.08.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2019.08.003												2026-01-16	WOS:000500190600005
J	Lau, JCY; Wong, PCM; Chandrasekaran, B				Lau, Joseph C. Y.; Wong, Patrick C. M.; Chandrasekaran, Bharath			Interactive effects of linguistic abstraction and stimulus statistics in the online modulation of neural speech encoding	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								Speech processing is highly modulated by context. Prior studies examining frequency-following responses (FFRs), an electrophysiological neurophonic' potential that faithfully reflects phase-locked activity from neural ensembles within the auditory network, have demonstrated that stimulus context modulates the integrity of speech encoding. The extent to which context-dependent encoding reflects general auditory properties or interactivities between statistical and higher-level linguistic processes remains unexplored. Our study examined whether speech encoding, as reflected by FFRs, is modulated by abstract phonological relationships between a stimulus and surrounding contexts. FFRs were elicited to a Mandarin rising-tone syllable (/ji-TR/, second') randomly presented with other syllables in three contexts from 17 native listeners. In a contrastive context, /ji-TR/ occurred with meaning-contrastive high-level-tone syllables (/ji-H/, one'). In an allotone context, TR occurred with dipping-tone syllables /ji-D/, a non-meaning-contrastive variant of /ji-TR/. In a repetitive context, the same /ji-TR/ occurred with other speech tokens of /ji-TR/. Consistent with prior work, neural tracking of /ji-TR/ pitch contour was more faithful in the repetitive condition wherein /ji-TR/ occurred more predictably (p =1) than in the contrastive condition (p =0.34). Crucially, in the allotone context, neural tracking of /ji-TR/ was more accurate relative to the contrastive context, despite both having an identical transitional probability (p =0.34). Mechanistically, the non-meaning-contrastive relationship may have augmented the probability to /ji-TR/ occurrence in the allotone context. Results indicate online interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms, which facilitate speech perception. Such interactivities may predictively fine-tune incoming speech encoding using linguistic and statistical information from prior context.												3	3											MAY	2019	81	4					1020	1033		10.3758/s13414-018-1621-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-018-1621-9												2026-01-16	WOS:000485098800011
J	Jin, SJ; Wang, SF; Lu, YA				Jin, Shao-Jie; Wang, Sheng-Fu; Lu, Yu-An			Identifying generalizable knowledge from the distribution of tonotactic accidental gaps in Mandarin	LABORATORY PHONOLOGY				Article								This study investigates tonotactic accidental gaps (unattested syllable-tone combinations) in Mandarin Chinese. In a corpus study, we found that, independent of syllable type, T2 (rising) and T3 (falling-rising) gaps were over-represented, whereas T1 (high level) and T4 (falling) gaps were under-represented. We also observed fewer T1 gaps with voiceless onsets and more T2 and T3 gaps with voiceless onsets, a pattern that is consistent with cross-linguistic observations. While these trends were generally reflected in a wordlikeness rating experiment by Mandarin listeners, their judgements of these gaps, similar to those of real words, were also guided by neighborhood density. Furthermore, T2 gaps with real-word T3 counterparts were rated as more wordlike, a result attributed to the T3 sandhi in Mandarin Chinese. Finally, we used harmonic scores generated from the UCLA Phonotactic Learner to explicitly test the role of lexical knowledge and markedness constraints in modeling speakers' tonotactic knowledge reflected in the wordlikeness ratings. We found that grammars induced from lexical data were the most successful at predicting wordlikeness ratings of gaps and lexical syllables combined. However, when focused on the ratings of tonotactic gaps, grammars with markedness constraints informed by cross-linguistic observations were more successful even without the constraints being weighted on lexical data. The results show how lexical knowledge and universal markedness, which is not entirely learnable from the lexicon, may account for some tonotactic generalizations.												1	1											JUL 27	2023	14	1							6455	10.16995/labphon.6455	http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/labphon.6455												2026-01-16	WOS:001044735500001
J	Chen, YY				Chen, Yiya			How does phonology guide phonetics in segment-f0 interaction?	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								The phonetics and phonology of consonant-f0 interaction in Shanghai Chinese were examined to further refine our understanding of consonant-f0 interaction in general. Bi-syllabic nouns, which form tone sandhi domains, were elicited within template sentences. These nouns vary in (1) lexical tone of the sandhi domain-initial syllable; (2) laryngeal contrast in the stop onset of the second syllable; and (3) discourse context (i.e., with focus vs. without focus). Results suggest that the interaction of stop onset and f0 in the sandhi domain non-initial syllables in Shanghai Chinese cannot be just attributed to the phonetic implementation of the phonological feature contrast in the language (as suggested by the tone-consonant co-occurrence pattern in tone sandhi domain-initial position), nor can it be due to purely automatic results of consonant production. Rather, the observed f0 perturbation pattern suggests the interaction of both effects. Speakers do voluntarily control their articulatory settings, at least to some extent, so as to enhance the stop contrast. Such voluntary control of articulation is dependent on both tonal and discourse context. Furthermore, complex laryngeal settings, which may not condition categorical co-occurrence patterns between tone and consonant, can nevertheless determine in part patterns of consonant-f0 interaction in the language. Our results also have implications for consonant feature specifications and their phonetic implication in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Early Development of Neural Speech Encoding Depends on Age but Not Native Language Status: Evidence From Lexical Tone	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE				Article; Proceedings Paper	2019 Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping	JUN 09-13, 2019	Rome, ITALY					We investigated the development of early-latency and long-latency brain responses to native and non-native speech to shed light on the neurophysiological underpinnings of perceptual narrowing and early language development. Specifically, we postulated a two-level process to explain the decrease in sensitivity to non-native phonemes toward the end of infancy. Neurons at the earlier stages of the ascending auditory pathway mature rapidly during infancy facilitating the encoding of both native and non-native sounds. This growth enables neurons at the later stages of the auditory pathway to assign phonological status to speech according to the infant's native language environment. To test this hypothesis, we collected early-latency and long-latency neural responses to native and non-native lexical tones from 85 Cantonese-learning children aged between 23 days and 24 months, 16 days. As expected, a broad range of presumably subcortical early-latency neural encoding measures grew rapidly and substantially during the first two years for both native and non-native tones. By contrast, long-latency cortical electrophysiological changes occurred on a much slower scale and showed sensitivity to nativeness at around six months. Our study provided a comprehensive understanding of early language development by revealing the complementary roles of earlier and later stages of speech processing in the developing brain.												8	9												2022	3	1					67	86		10.1162/nol_a_00049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/nol_a_00049												2026-01-16	WOS:000911639900004

LINGUISTIC REVIEW				Article								There is increasing evidence that many languages encode prosodic focus not only with phonetic variations in the focused component itself, but also with a reduction of pitch range and intensity of the post-focus components, a strategy known as post-focus compression (PFC). However, evidence is also emerging that in many other languages prosodic encoding of focus is markedly different, suggesting that PFC might be related to factors such as the presence of lexical tone, stress or the availability of morphosyntactic means of signaling focus. The current study investigated the production and perception of focus in Taiwanese, Taiwan Mandarin and Beijing Mandarin, three languages/dialects that are all tonal and that have similar morphosyntactic means for indicating focus. Results showed clear evidence of PFC in Beijing Mandarin but lack of it in Taiwanese and Taiwan Mandarin, suggesting that PFC is independent of the factors mentioned above. Most interestingly, Taiwan Mandarin seems to have lost PFC due to close contact with Taiwanese despite its effectiveness as demonstrated by the perceptual experiment. The new findings, taken together with other recent finding about prosodic focus, seem to suggest that PFC is a "hard-to-evolve" prosodic feature that may have a single historical origin. Thus there is a need for large scale experimental research to explore the cross-linguistic distribution of PFC, so as to broaden our understanding of not only prosodic typology, but also language contact, bilingualism and language evolution in general.												81	96											MAR	2012	29	1					131	147		10.1515/tlr-2012-0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/tlr-2012-0006												2026-01-16	WOS:000314226600006
J	Lameris, TJ; Li, KK; Post, B				Lameris, Tim Joris; Li, Katrina Kechun; Post, Brechtje			Phonetic and Phono-Lexical Accuracy of Non-Native Tone Production by English-L1 and Mandarin-L1 Speakers	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								Lexical tones are known to be a challenging aspect of speech to acquire in a second language, but several factors are known to affect tone learning facility, such as L1 tonal status (whether a learner's L1 is tonal or not), tone type (the shape of the tones to be acquired), and individual extralinguistic factors (such as musicianship, pitch aptitude, and working memory). Crucially, most of our knowledge of the effect of these factors is based on evidence from perception. The production side of tone learning and the origins of individual variability in learning facility remain relatively understudied. To this end, this study investigated non-native tone production-both in terms of phonetic accuracy in a pseudoword imitation task and in terms of phono-lexical accuracy in a picture-naming task-by English-L1 and Mandarin-L1 speakers. Results show that L1 tonal status and tone type dynamically affected both imitation and picture-naming accuracy, as there were specific accuracy patterns for the English and Mandarin groups. Production accuracy was further facilitated by individual musical experience, working memory, and pitch aptitude. This study's findings add to the currently limited literature on how both language-specific and individual extralinguistic factors modulate non-native tone processing in the speaking modality.												9	9											DEC	2023	66	4					974	1006		10.1177/00238309221143719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00238309221143719		JAN 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:000914195000001

Language-dependent pitch encoding advantage in the brainstem is not limited to acceleration rates that occur in natural speech	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								Experience-dependent enhancement of neural encoding of pitch in the auditory brainstem has been observed for only specific portions of native pitch contours exhibiting high rates of pitch acceleration, irrespective of speech or nonspeech contexts. This experiment allows us to determine whether this language-dependent advantage transfers to acceleration rates that extend beyond the pitch range of natural speech. Brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) were recorded from Chinese and English participants in response to four, 250-ms dynamic click-train stimuli with different rates of pitch acceleration. The maximum pitch acceleration rates in a given stimulus ranged from low (0.3 Hz/ms; Mandarin Tone 2) to high (2.7 Hz/ms; 2 octaves). Pitch strength measurements were computed from the FFRs using autocorrelation algorithms with an analysis window centered at the point of maximum pitch acceleration in each stimulus. Between-group comparisons of pitch strength revealed that Chinese exhibit more robust pitch representation than English across all four acceleration rates. Regardless of language group, pitch strength was greater in response to acceleration rates within or proximal to natural speech relative to those beyond its range. Though both groups showed decreasing pitch strength with increasing acceleration rates, pitch representations of the Chinese group were more resistant to degradation. FFR spectral data were complementary across acceleration rates. These findings demonstrate that perceptually salient pitch cues associated with lexical tone influence brainstem pitch extraction not only in the speech domain, but also in auditory signals that clearly fall outside the range of dynamic pitch that a native listener is exposed to.

However, studies on novel word learning have largely concentrated on consonants and vowels. To shed more light on the use of tonal information in novel word learning and its relationship with the development of phonological categories, the present study explored how adults' ability to learn minimal pair pseudowords in a tone language is modulated by their native phonological knowledge. Twenty-four adult speakers of three languages were tested: Cantonese, Mandarin, and French. Eye-tracking was used to record eye movements of these learners, while they were watching animated cartoons in Cantonese. On each trial, adults had to learn two new label-object associations, while the labels differed minimally by a consonant, a vowel, or a tone. Learning would therefore attest to participants' ability to use phonological information to distinguish the paired words. Results first revealed that adult learners in each language group performed better than chance in all conditions. Moreover, compared to native Cantonese adults, both Mandarin-and French-speaking adults performed worse on all three contrasts. In addition, French adults were worse on tones when compared to Mandarin adults. Lastly, no advantage for consonantal information in native lexical processing was found for Cantonese-speaking adults as predicted by the "division of labor" proposal, thus confirming crosslinguistic differences in consonant/vowel weight between speakers of tonal vs. non-tonal languages. These findings establish rapid novel word learning in a non-native language (long-term learning will have to be further assessed), modulated by native phonological knowledge. The implications of the findings of this adult study for further infant word learning studies are discussed.												28	29											JUL 24	2018	9								1211	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01211												2026-01-16	WOS:000439612800002
J	Dong, HY; Clayards, M; Brown, H; Wonnacott, E				Dong, Hanyu; Clayards, Meghan; Brown, Helen; Wonnacott, Elizabeth			The effects of high versus low talker variability and individual aptitude on phonetic training of Mandarin lexical tones	PEERJ				Article								High variability (HV) training has been found to be more effective than low variability (LV) training when learning various non-native phonetic contrasts. However, little research has considered whether this applies to the learning of tone contrasts. The only two relevant studies suggested that the effect of HV training depends on the perceptual aptitude of participants (Perrachione et al., 2011; Sadakata & McQueen, 2014). The present study extends these findings by examining the interaction between individual aptitude and input variability using natural, meaningful second language input (both previous studies used pseudowords). A total of 60 English speakers took part in an eight session phonetic training paradigm. They were assigned to high/low/high-blocked variability training groups and learned real Mandarin tones and words. Individual aptitude was measured following previous work. Learning was measured using one discrimination task, one identification task and two production tasks. All tasks assessed generalization. All groups improved in both the production and perception of tones which transferred to untrained voices and items, demonstrating the effectiveness of training despite the increased complexity compared with previous research. Although the LV group exhibited an advantage with the training stimuli, there was no evidence for a benefit of high-variability in any of the tests of generalisation. Moreover, although aptitude significantly predicted performance in discrimination, identification and training tasks, no interaction between individual aptitude and variability was revealed. Additional Bayes Factor analyses indicated substantial evidence for the null for the hypotheses of a benefit of high-variability in generalisation, however the evidence regarding the interaction was ambiguous. We discuss these results in light of previous findings.												36	37											AUG 9	2019	7								e7191	10.7717/peerj.7191	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7191												2026-01-16	WOS:000480310600001

Design: The participants included four groups: (1) 26 children with NH, (2) 13 children with bimodal devices, (3) 31 children with bilateral CIs that were implanted sequentially, and (4) 10 children with bilateral CIs that were implanted simultaneously. All participants were aged between 7 and 11 years old. Each participant was recorded singing a self-chosen song that was familiar to him or her. The fundamental frequencies (F0) of individual sung notes were extracted and normalized to facilitate cross-subject comparisons. Pitch accuracy was quantified using four pitch-based metrics calculated with reference to the target music notes: mean note deviation, contour direction, mean interval deviation, and F0 variance ratio. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare listener-group difference on each pitch metric. A principal component analysis showed that the mean note deviation best accounted for pitch accuracy in vocal singing. A regression analysis examined potential predictors of CI children's singing proficiency using mean note deviation as the dependent variable and demographic and audiological factors as independent variables. Results: The results revealed significantly poorer performance on all four pitch-based metrics in the three groups of children with CIs in comparison to children with NH. No significant differences were found among the three CI groups. Among the children with CIs, variability in the vocal singing proficiency was large. Within the group of 13 bimodal users, the mean note deviation was significantly correlated with their unaided pure-tone average thresholds (r = 0.582, p = 0.037). The regression analysis for all children with CIs, however, revealed no significant demographic or audiological predictor for their vocal singing performance. Conclusion: Vocal singing performance in children with bilateral CIs or bimodal devices is not significantly different from each other on a group level. Compared to children with NH, the pediatric bimodal and bilateral CI users, in general, demonstrated significant deficits in vocal singing ability. Demographic and audiological factors, known from previous studies to be associated with good speech and language development in prelingually-deafened children with CIs, were not associated with singing accuracy for these children.												5	6											JUL-AUG	2022	43	4					1336	1346		10.1097/AUD.0000000000001189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000001189												2026-01-16	WOS:000813278900023

Reduced tone awareness is widely reported in children with reading difficulties (RD). Lexical-tone processing requires sensitivity to frequency-modulated sound changes. The present study investigates whether reduced tone awareness in children with RD is reflected in basic auditory processing and the level at which the breakdown occurs. Magnetoencephalographic techniques and an oddball paradigm were used to elicit auditory-related neural responses. Five frequency sweep conditions were established to mirror the frequency fluctuation in Chinese lexical tones, including one standard (level) sweep and four deviant sweeps (fast-up, fast-down, slow-up, and slow-down). A total of 14 Chinese-speaking children aged 9-12 years with RD and 13 age-matched typically developing children were recruited. The participants completed a magnetoencephalographic data acquisition session, during which they watched a silent cartoon and the auditory stimuli were presented in a pseudorandomized order. The results revealed that the significant between-group difference was caused by differences in the level of auditory sensory processing, reflected by the P1m component elicited by the slow-up frequency sweep. This finding indicated that auditory sensory processing was affected by both the duration and the direction of a frequency sweep. Sensitivity to changes in duration and frequency is crucial for the processing of suprasegmental features. Therefore, this sensory deficit might be associated with difficulties discriminating two tones with an upward frequency contour in Chinese.												1	2											AUG 11	2020	11								1649	10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01649	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01649												2026-01-16	WOS:000565328700001
J	Wewalaarachchi, TD; Singh, L				Wewalaarachchi, Thilanga D.; Singh, Leher			Effects of Suprasegmental Phonological Alternations on Early Word Recognition: Evidence from Tone Sandhi	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Early language acquisition is potentially complicated by the presence of many sources of variability in the speech signal. A frequent example of variability is phonological alternations, which can lead to context-driven changes in the realization of a word. The aim of the current study was to investigate effects of a highly frequent yet scarcely researched type of suprasegmental phonological alternation - tone Sandhi - on early spoken word recognition. The tone Sandhi rule investigated herein involves a tone change of the first syllable in a disyllabic unit. In accordance with third tone Sandhi, when two dipping tone syllables are juxtaposed in connected speech, the first syllable is dissimilated to a high rising tone. For example, 'flour mill' (unaltered pre-Sandhi form [fan(214) ts(h)an(214)]) undergoes tonal alternation resulting in the altered post-Sandhi form [fan(35) ts(h)an(214)]. In the current study, preschoolers' sensitivity to the effects of tone Sandhi when processing familiar words was investigated via a preferential looking paradigm. Words varied in their phonological form: one set of words was labeled with a phonological alternation due to Sandhi (Post Sandhi), one set of words was labeled with an unaltered Sandhi form (Pre Sandhi), one set consisted of non Sandhi words (Correct Pronunciation, and one set were labeled with a tonal alternation not associated with Sandhi rules (Mispronunciation). Post-Sandhi forms and correct pronunciations were associated with visual referents with comparable strength, with only a subtle processing cost observed for post-Sandhi forms in the time course of lexical selection. Likewise, pre-Sandhi forms and true mispronunciations were rejected as labels for visual references with comparable strength, with only subtle differences observed in the time course of lexical selection. Findings are discussed in terms of their impact on prevailing theories of lexical representation.												7	7											MAY 3	2016	7								627	10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00627	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00627												2026-01-16	WOS:000375250700001

Increased Right Frontal Brain Activity During the Mandarin Hearing-in-Noise Test	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Purpose Previous studies have revealed increased frontal brain activation during speech comprehension in background noise. Few, however, used tonal languages. The normal pattern of brain activation during a challenging speech-in-nose task using a tonal language remains unclear. The Mandarin Hearing-in-Noise Test (HINT) is a well-established test for assessing the ability to interpret speech in background noise. The current study used Mandarin HINT (MHINT) sentences and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess brain activation with MHINT sentences. Methods Thirty native Mandarin-speaking subjects with normal peripheral hearing were recruited. Functional MRI was performed while subjects were presented with either HINT "clear" sentences with low-level background noise [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = +3 dB] or "noisy" sentences with high-level background noise (SNR = -5 dB). Subjects were instructed to answer with a button press whether a visually presented target word was included in the sentence. Brain activation between noisy and clear sentences was compared. Activation in each condition was also compared to a resting, no sentence presentation, condition. Results Noisy sentence comprehension showed increased activity in areas associated with tone processing and working memory, including the right superior and middle frontal gyri [Brodmann Areas (BAs) 46, 10]. Reduced activity with noisy sentences was seen in auditory, language, memory and somatosensory areas, including the bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri, left Heschl's gyrus (BAs 21, 22), right temporal pole (BA 38), bilateral amygdala-hippocampus junction, and parahippocampal gyrus (BAs 28, 35), left inferior parietal lobule extending to left postcentral gyrus (BAs 2, 40), and left putamen. Conclusion Increased frontal activation in the right hemisphere occurred when comprehending noisy spoken sentences in Mandarin. Compared to studies using non-tonal languages, this activation was strongly right-sided and involved subregions not previously reported. These findings may reflect additional effort in lexical tone perception in this tonal language. Additionally, this continuous fMRI protocol may offer a time-efficient way to assess group differences in brain activation with a challenging speech-in-noise task.												8	8											DEC 17	2020	14								614012	10.3389/fnins.2020.614012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.614012												2026-01-16	WOS:000603625400001
J	Bidelman, GM; Gandour, JT; Krishnan, A				Bidelman, Gavin M.; Gandour, Jackson T.; Krishnan, Ananthanarayan			Cross-domain Effects of Music and Language Experience on the Representation of Pitch in the Human Auditory Brainstem	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Neural encoding of pitch in the auditory brainstem is known to be shaped by long-term experience with language or music, implying that early sensory processing is subject to experience-dependent neural plasticity. In language, pitch patterns consist of sequences of continuous, curvilinear contours; in music, pitch patterns consist of relatively discrete, stair-stepped sequences of notes. The primary aim was to determine the influence of domain-specific experience (language vs. music) on the encoding of pitch in the brainstem. Frequency-following responses were recorded from the brainstem in native Chinese, English amateur musicians, and English nonmusicians in response to iterated rippled noise homologues of a musical pitch interval (major third; M3) and a lexical tone (Mandarin tone 2; T2) from the music and language domains, respectively. Pitch-tracking accuracy (whole contour) and pitch strength (50 msec sections) were computed from the brainstem responses using autocorrelation algorithms. Pitch-tracking accuracy was higher in the Chinese and musicians than in the nonmusicians across domains. Pitch strength was more robust across sections in musicians than in nonmusicians regardless of domain. In contrast, the Chinese showed larger pitch strength, relative to nonmusicians, only in those sections of T2 with rapid changes in pitch. Interestingly, musicians exhibited greater pitch strength than the Chinese in one section of M3, corresponding to the onset of the second musical note, and two sections within T2, corresponding to a note along the diatonic musical scale. We infer that experience-dependent plasticity of brainstem responses is shaped by the relative saliency of acoustic dimensions underlying the pitch patterns associated with a particular domain.												266	311											FEB	2011	23	2					425	434		10.1162/jocn.2009.21362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2009.21362												2026-01-16	WOS:000283356500014

Methods: Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses were collected from 43 children with severe and profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and 20 children with normal hearing (age: 3-6 years). In the non-verbal stimulation condition, pure tones with frequencies of 1 kHz and 1.1 kHz were used as the standard and the deviant respectively. In the verbal stimulation condition, the Chinese mandarin tokens/ ba2/and/ba4/were used as the standard and the deviant respectively. Latency and amplitude of the MMN responses were collected and analyzed. Results: Overall, children with hearing loss showed longer latencies and lower amplitudes of the MMN responses to both non-verbal and verbal stimulations. The latency of the verbal/ba2/-/ba4/pair was longer than that of the nonverbal 1 kHz-1.1 kHz pair in both groups of children. Conclusions: Children with hearing loss, especially those who received intervention after 2 years of age, showed substantial weakness in the neural responses to lexical tones and pure tones. Thus, the chronological age when the children receive hearing intervention may have an impact on the effectiveness of discriminating between verbal and non-verbal signals.

Although there is a wealth of knowledge from studies of second language (L2) tone learning, it remains unclear how L2 learners process acoustic versus phonological information differently depending on whether their first language (L1) is a tonal language. In the present study, we first examined proficient L2 learners of Mandarin with tonal and nontonal L1 in a behavioral experiment (identifying a Mandarin tonal continuum) to construct tonal contrasts that could differentiate the phonological from the acoustic information in Mandarin lexical tones for the L2 learners. We then conducted an ERP experiment to investigate these learners' automatic processing of acoustic and phonological information in Mandarin lexical tones by mismatch negativity (MMN). Although both groups of L2 learners showed similar behavioral identification features for the Mandarin tonal continuum as native speakers, L2 learners with nontonal L1, as compared with both native speakers and L2 learners with tonal L1, showed longer reaction time to the tokens of the Mandarin tonal continuum. More importantly, the MMN data further revealed distinct roles of acoustic and phonological information on the automatic processing of L2 lexical tones between the two groups of L2 learners. Taken together, the results indicate that the processing of acoustic and phonological information in L2 lexical tones may be modulated by L1 experience with a tonal language. The theoretical implications of the current study are discussed in light of models of L2 speech learning.												37	38											NOV	2019	56	11							e13448	10.1111/psyp.13448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13448		JUL 2019										2026-01-16	WOS:000478443900001
J	Hsu, CH; Lin, SK; Hsu, YY; Lee, CY				Hsu, Chun-Hsien; Lin, Sheng-Kai; Hsu, Yuan-Yu; Lee, Chia-Ying			The neural generators of the mismatch responses to Mandarin lexical tones: An MEG study	BRAIN RESEARCH				Article								The present magnetoencephalography study used the cortically constrained minimumnorm estimates of human brain activity to elucidate functional roles of neural generators for detecting different magnitudes of lexical tones changes. A multiple-deviant oddball paradigm was used in which the syllable "yi" with a low-dipping tone (T3) was the common standard sound and the same syllable with a high-level tone (T1) or a high-rising tone (T2) were the large and small deviant sounds, respectively. The data revealed a larger magnetic Mismatch field (MMNm) for large deviant in the left hemisphere. The source analysis also confirmed that the MMNm to lexical tone changes was generated in bilateral superior temporal gyri and only the large deviant revealed left lateralization. A set of frontal generators was activated at a later time and revealed differential sensitivities to the degree of deviance. The left anterior insula, the right anterior cingulate cortex, and the right ventral orbital frontal cortex were activated when detecting a large deviant, whereas the right frontal-opercular region was sensitive to the small deviant. These frontal generators were thought to be associated with various top-down mechanisms for attentional modulation. The time frequency (TF) analysis showed that large deviants yielded large theta band (5-7 Hz) activity over the left anterior scalp and the left central scalp, while small deviants yielded large alpha band activity (9-11 Hz) over the posterior scalp. The results of TF analyses implied that mechanisms of working memory and functional inhibition involved in the processes of acoustic change detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bi, YF; Chen, YY				Bi, Yifei; Chen, Yiya			The effects of lexical frequency and homophone neighborhood density on incomplete tonal neutralization	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								We investigated the effects of lexical frequency and homophone neighborhood density on the acoustic realization of two neutralizing falling tones in Dalian Mandarin Chinese. Monosyllabic morphemes containing the target tones (Tone 1 and Tone 4) were produced by 60 native speakers from two generations (middle-aged vs. young). The duration of tone-bearing syllable rhymes, as well as the F0 curves and velocity profiles of the lexical tones were quantitatively analyzed via linear mixed-effects modeling and functional data analysis. Results showed no durational difference between T1 and T4. However, the F0 contours of the two falling tones were incompletely neutralized for both young and middle-aged speakers. Lexical frequency showed little effect on the incomplete tonal neutralization; there were significant differences in the turning point of the two falling tones in syllables with both high and low lexical frequency. However, homophone neighborhood density showed an effect on the incomplete neutralization between the two falling tones, reflected in significant differences in the slope and turning point of the F0 velocity profiles between the two tones carried by syllables with low density but not with high density. Moreover, homophone neighborhood density also affected the duration, the turning point of F0 curves, and velocity profiles of the T1- and T4-syllables. These results are discussed with consideration of social phonetic variations, the theory of Hypo- and Hyper-articulation (H&H), the Neighborhood Activation Model, and communication-based information-theoretic accounts. Collectively, these results broaden our understanding of the effects that lexical properties have on the acoustic details of lexical tone production and tonal sound changes.												2	3											NOV 24	2022	13								867353	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.867353	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.867353												2026-01-16	WOS:000894163500001
J	Tang, P; Yuen, I; Rattanasone, NX; Gao, LQ; Demuth, K				Tang, Ping; Yuen, Ivan; Rattanasone, Nan Xu; Gao, Liqun; Demuth, Katherine			The Acquisition of Mandarin Tonal Processes by Children With Cochlear Implants	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Children with cochlear implants (CIs) face challenges in acquiring tonal languages, as CIs do not efficiently code pitch information. Mandarin is a tonal language with lexical tones and tonal processes such as neutral tone and tone sandhi, exhibiting contextually conditioned tonal realizations. Previous studies suggest that early implantation and long CI experience facilitate the acquisition of lexical tones by children with CIs. However, there is lack of acoustic evidence on children's tonal productions demonstrating that this is the case, and it is unclear whether and how children with CIs are able to acquire contextual tones. This study therefore examined the acoustic realization of both lexical tones and contextual tones as produced by children fitted with CIs, exploring the potential effects of age at implantation and length of CI experience on their acquisition of the Mandarin tonal system. Method: Seventy-two Mandarin-learning preschoolers with CIs, varying in age at implantation (13-42 months) and length of CI experience (2-49 months), and 44 normal hearing 3-year-old controls were recruited. Tonal productions were elicited from both groups using picture-naming tasks and acoustically compared. Results: Only the early implanted group (i.e., implanted before the age of 2 years) produced normal-like lexical tones and generally had contextual tones approximating those of the normal-hearing children. The other children, including those with longer CI experience, did not have typical tonal productions; their pitch patterns for lexical tones tended to be flatter, and contextual tone productions were unchanged across tonal contexts. Conclusion: Children with CIs face challenges in acquiring Mandarin tones, but early implantation may help them to develop normal-like lexical tone categories, which further facilitates their implementation of contextual tones.												30	30											MAY	2019	62	5					1309	1325		10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-18-0304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-18-0304												2026-01-16	WOS:000469202500006
J	Biocina, Z; Varosanec-Skaric, G; Basic, I				Biocina, Zdravka; Varosanec-Skaric, Gordana; Basic, Iva			THE PROSODIC SISTEM OF PRAZNICA	FLUMINENSIA				Article								This paper examines the prosodic system of the Cakavian dialect of Praznica. Previous studies of Cakavian dialects spoken on the island of Brac have revealed the existence of a classic Cakavian three-accent system, consisting of a short-falling accent, a long-falling accent, and an acute, as well as pre-accentual length. This paper does not intend to question previous studies of the Brac local dialects, because these have been based mainly on listeners' perceptions, but it intends to demonstrate and describe the complex prosodic system of the dialect of Praznica through acoustic analysis. Furthermore, the paper aims to find out if older speakers have preserved a more archaic prosodic system in comparison with groups of younger and middle-aged speakers. For this purpose, 15 speakers were recorded and divided into groups according to age and gender. The criteria for selecting the speakers were that they had to be originally from Praznica, that they had lived there for the last 10 years, and that both of their parents were from Praznica. The material for recording consisted of an open list of topics for spontaneous spoken utterance. Words with the least influence of sentence intonation on the lexical tone were chosen for acoustic analysis in Praat. Frequency direction, frequency range, and duration as well as the tone level of the post-accented syllable were calculated and examined for vowels with different accents and phonological quantity. The results of the acoustic analysis show that the speakers from Praznica, apart from the expected three Cakavian accents and pre-accentual length, also have short-rising and long-rising accents and post-accentual length. No major differences were found in the prosodic system in terms of age or gender, except for greater tone differentiation among female speakers.												0	0												2018	30	1					103	126		10.31820/f.30.1.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.31820/f.30.1.6												2026-01-16	WOS:000433006000008
J	Neergaard, KD; Xu, HZ; German, JS; Huang, CR				Neergaard, Karl David; Xu, Hongzhi; German, James S.; Huang, Chu-Ren			Database of word-level statistics for Mandarin Chinese (DoWLS-MAN)	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS				Article								In this article we present the Database of Word-Level Statistics for Mandarin Chinese (DoWLS-MAN). The database addresses the lack of agreement in phonological syllable segmentation specific to Mandarin by offering phonological features for each lexical item according to 16 schematic representations of the syllable (8 with tone and 8 without tone). Those lexical statistics that differ per phonological word and nonword due to changes in syllable segmentation are of the variant category and include subtitle lexical frequency, phonological neighborhood density measures, homophone density, and network science measures. The invariant characteristics consist of each items' lexical tone, phonological transcription, and syllable structure among others. The goal of DoWLS-MAN is to provide researchers both the ability to choose stimuli that are derived from a segmentation schema that supports an existing model of Mandarin speech processing, and the ability to choose stimuli that allow for the testing of hypotheses on phonological segmentation according to multiple schemas. In an exploratory analysis we illustrate how multiple schematic representations of the phonological mental lexicon can aid in hypothesis generation, specifically in terms of phonological processing when reading Chinese orthography. Users of the database can search among over 92,000 words, over 1600 out-of-vocabulary Chinese characters, and 4300 phonological nonwords according to either Chinese orthography, pinyin, or ASCII phonetic script. Users can also generate a list of phonological words and nonwords according to user-defined ranges and categories of lexical characteristics. DoWLS-MAN is available to the public for search or download at .												9	10											APR	2022	54	2					987	1009		10.3758/s13428-021-01620-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01620-7		AUG 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000685711000003
J	Han, MR; de Jong, NH; Kager, R				Han, Mengru; de Jong, Nivja H.; Kager, Rene			Lexical Tones in Mandarin Chinese Infant-Directed Speech: Age-Related Changes in the Second Year of Life	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Tonal information is essential to early word learning in tone languages. Although numerous studies have investigated the intonational and segmental properties of infant-directed speech (IDS), only a few studies have explored the properties of lexical tones in IDS. These studies mostly focused on the first year of life; thus little is known about how lexical tones in IDS change as children's vocabulary acquisition accelerates in the second year (Goldfield and Reznick, 1990; Bloom, 2001). The present study examines whether Mandarin Chinese mothers hyperarticulate lexical tones in IDS addressing 18-and 24-month-old children-at which age children are learning words at a rapid speed-vs. adult-directed speech (ADS). Thirty-nine Mandarin Chinese-speaking mothers were tested in a semi-spontaneous picture-book-reading task, in which they told the same story to their child (IDS condition) and to an adult (ADS condition). Results for the F0 measurements (minimum F0, maximum F0, and F0 range) of tone in the speech data revealed a continuum of differences among IDS addressing 18-month-olds, IDS addressing 24-month-olds, and ADS. Lexical tones in IDS addressing 18-month-old children had a higher minimum F0, higher maximum F0, and larger pitch range than lexical tones in ADS. Lexical tones in IDS addressing 24-month-old children showed more similarity to ADS tones with respect to pitch height: there were no differences in minimum F0 and maximum F0 between ADS and IDS. However, F0 range was still larger. These results suggest that lexical tones are generally hyperarticulated in Mandarin Chinese IDS addressing 18-and 24-month-old children despite the change in pitch level over time. Mandarin Chinese mothers hyperarticulate lexical tones in IDS when talking to toddlers and potentially facilitate tone acquisition and word learning.												13	14											APR 4	2018	9								434	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00434	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00434												2026-01-16	WOS:000429243200001

Functional ear (a)symmetry in brainstem neural activity relevant to encoding of voice pitch: A precursor for hemispheric specialization?	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE				Article								Pitch processing is lateralized to the right hemisphere; linguistic pitch is further mediated by left cortical areas. This experiment investigates whether ear asymmetries vary in brainstem representation of pitch depending on linguistic status. Brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) were elicited by monaural stimulation of the left and right ear of 15 native speakers of Mandarin Chinese using two synthetic speech stimuli that differ in linguistic status of tone. One represented a native lexical tone (Tone 2: 12); the other, T2', a nonnative variant in which the pitch contour was a mirror image of T2 with the same starting and ending frequencies. Two 40-ms portions of f(0) contours were selected in order to compare two regions (R1, early: R2 late) differing in pitch acceleration rate and perceptual saliency. In R2, linguistic status effects revealed that T2 exhibited a larger degree of FFR rightward ear asymmetry as reflected in f(0) amplitude relative to T2'. Relative to midline (ear asymmetry = 0), the only ear asymmetry reaching significance was that favoring left ear stimulation elicited by T2'. By left- and right-ear stimulation separately, FFRs elicited by T2 were larger than T2' in the right ear only. Within T2', FFRs elicited by the earlier region were larger than the later in both ears. Within T2, no significant differences in FFRS were observed between regions in either ear. Collectively, these findings support the idea that origins of cortical processing preferences for perceptually-salient portions of pitch are rooted in early, preattentive stages of processing in the brainstem.

J	Liu, DX; Hu, J; Dong, RJ; Chen, J; Musacchia, G; Wang, S				Liu, Dongxin; Hu, Jiong; Dong, Ruijuan; Chen, Jing; Musacchia, Gabriella; Wang, Shuo			Effects of Inter-Stimulus Interval on Speech-Evoked Frequency-Following Response in Elderly Adults	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Background: The speech-evoked frequency following response (FFR) has shown to be useful in assessing complex auditory processing abilities and in different age groups. While many aspects of FFR have been studied extensively, the effect of timing, as measured by inter-stimulus-interval (ISI), especially in the older adult population, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different ISIs on speech evoked FFR in older and younger adults who speak a tonal language, and to investigate whether the older adults' FFR were more susceptible to the change in ISI. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two normal hearing participants were recruited in our study, including 11 young adult participants and 11 elderly participants. An Intelligent Hearing Systems Smart EP evoke potential system was used to record the FFR in four ISI conditions (40, 80, 120 and 160 ms). A recorded natural speech token with a falling tone /yi/ was used as the stimulus. Two indices, stimulus-to-response correlation coefficient and pitch strength, were used to quantify the FFR responses. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the differences in different age groups and different ISI conditions. Results: There was no significant difference in stimulus-to-response correlation coefficient and pitch strength among the different ISI conditions, in either age groups. Older adults appeared to have weaker FFR for all ISI conditions when compared to their younger adult counterparts. Conclusion: Shorter ISIs did not result in worse FFRs from older adults or younger adults. For speech-evoked FFR using a recorded natural speech token that is 250 ms in length, an ISI of as short as 40 ms appeared to be sufficient and effective to record FFR for elderly adults.												3	6											NOV 8	2018	10								357	10.3389/fnagi.2018.00357	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00357												2026-01-16	WOS:000449611300001
J	Steien, GB; van Dommelen, WA				Steien, Guri Bordal; van Dommelen, Wim A.			The production of Norwegian tones by multilingual non-native speakers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUALISM				Article								Aim and objectives/purpose/research questions: The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which multilingual second language (L2) speakers of Norwegian manage to produce lexical pitch accents (L*H- or H*LH<(-)) as expected in natural spontaneous speech. Using native speech as a reference, we analyse realizations of multilingual speakers whose respective dominant languages are Lingala, a lexical tone language, and Swahili, a non-tonal language with fixed stress, and hypothesize that this difference might be reflected in the speakers' competence in the East Norwegian tone system. Design/methodology/approach: We examined a corpus of spontaneous speech produced by eight L2 speakers and two native speakers of East Norwegian. Acoustic analysis was performed to collect fundamental frequency (f0) contours of 60 accentual phrases per speaker. Data and analysis: For LH and HLH tonal patterns, measuring points were defined for quantitative evaluation of f0 values. Relevant aspects investigated were (a) pattern consistency, (b) f0 dynamic range and (c) rate of f0 change. Pattern consistency data were statistically evaluated using chi-square testing. The dynamic range and rate of f0 change data were explored through to linear mixed effects models. Findings/conclusions: We found no really substantial differences between the speaker groups in the parameters we examined, neither between the L2 speakers and the Norwegian natives nor between the Lingala and Swahili speakers. Originality and significance/implications: This study is a contribution to the scarcely explored area of L2 acquisition of tones. It is concerned with languages that have received little or no attention in the field: Norwegian, Lingala and Swahili. Participants are multilinguals who have extensive language learning experience. Further, the study is based on a corpus of spontaneous speech.												3	4											JUN	2018	22	3					316	329		10.1177/1367006916673218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367006916673218												2026-01-16	WOS:000433198900004
J	Li, Y; Shen, M; Long, M				Li, Yuan; Shen, Min; Long, Mo			A preliminary study of auditory mismatch response on the day of cochlear implant activation in children with hearing aids prior implantation	PLOS ONE				Article								Objective The study aimed to explore the characteristics of auditory mismatch response (MMR) in hearing-impaired children on the day when the cochlear implant (CI) was started (power-up) and the speech processor was programmed, and to investigate the effects of wearing hearing aids (HAs) before cochlear implantation on the early stage of postoperative auditory cortex plasticity, providing some demonstrative data for the objective evaluation of postoperative early auditory ability in children who underwent cochlear implantation. Methods The participants were 34 children with profound sensorineural hearing loss, who underwent cochlear implantation. The classical passive Oddball paradigm was adopted, using a pair of vowels which only have different lexical tones. The standard stimulus was /a2/ and the devious stimulus was /a4/. Results 1) On the day of CI activation, the auditory MMR has been elicited in 30 children; the MMR incidence was 88%. 2) We observed both positive and negative auditory MMR waveforms. And logistic regression analysis showed that it was influenced by the age at cochlear implantation. 3) The duration with HA before surgery significantly influenced the MMR latency. The children with longer duration of HA use have much earlier latency of MMR. 4) There was a significant positive correlation between the age at HA use initiation and MMR amplitude. Earlier initial HA use was associated with smaller amplitude. Conclusions MMR in response to Mandarin lexical tone can be recorded in most pediatric patients who had experience with HA on the day of CI power up. MMR is closely associated with the age at cochlear implantation, duration of HA use, and the age at HA use initiation. Hearing impaired children should wear HA as early as possible and ensure consistent usage.												6	7											JAN 7	2019	14	1							e0210457	10.1371/journal.pone.0210457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210457												2026-01-16	WOS:000455045900076
J	Ma, XR; McPherson, B; Ma, L				Ma, Xiaoran; McPherson, Bradley; Ma, Lian			Behavioral assessment of auditory processing disorder in children with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY				Article								Objective: Peripheral hearing disorders have been frequently described in children with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P). However, auditory processing problems are rarely considered for children with NSCL/P despite their poor academic performance in general compared to their craniofacially normal peers. This study aimed to compare auditory processing skills, using behavioral assessment techniques, in school age children with and without NSCL/P. Methods: One hundred and forty one Mandarin-speaking children with NSCL/P aged from 6.00 to 15.67 years, and 60 age-matched, craniofacially normal children, were recruited. Standard hearing health tests were conducted to evaluate peripheral hearing. Behavioral auditory processing assessment included adaptive tests of temporal resolution (ATTR), and the Mandarin pediatric lexical tone and disyllabic-word picture identification test in noise (MAPPID-N). Results: Age effects were found in children with cleft disorder but not in the control group for gap detection thresholds with ATTR narrow band noise in the across-channel stimuli condition, with a significant difference in test performance between the 6 to 8 year group and 12 to 15 year group of children with NSCL/P. For MAPPID-N, the bilateral cleft lip and palate subgroup showed significantly poorer SNR-50% scores than the control group in the condition where speech was spatially separated from noise. Also, the cleft palate participants showed a significantly smaller spatial separation advantage for speech recognition in noise compared to the control group children. Conclusion: ATM gap detection test results indicated that maturation for temporal resolution abilities was not achieved in children with NSCL/P until approximately 8 years of age compared to approximately 6 years for craniofacially normal children. For speech recognition in noisy environments, poorer abilities to use timing and intensity cues were found in children with cleft palate and children with bilateral cleft lip and palate compared to craniofacially normal children. Consequently, it is worthwhile to consider the potential for auditory processing disorder in when assessing the auditory status of children with NSCL/P. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It remains unclear how phonological, orthographic, and semantic skills contribute to reading fluency of Chinese school-age children with HL. The present study explored this issue by examining the performances of children with HL on reading fluency and three linguistic skills compared with matched controls with normal hearing (NH). Specifically, twenty-eight children with HL and 28 chronological-age-matched children with NH were tested on word/sentence reading fluency (WRF/SRF), phonological awareness (PA) which was composed of onset/vowel/lexical tone awareness, orthographic knowledge (OK), and semantic competence (SC) which comprised animal word identification, pseudo-homophone detection, and word segmentation. Results showed that children with HL lagged behind their peers with NH in WRF/SRF and most of the phonological, orthographic, and semantic subskills except onset awareness and pseudo-homophone detection. Furthermore, the significant contributors to WRF differed between the two groups with PA being the significant contributor in the children with NH while OK being the significant contributor in the children with HL. However, the significant contributor to SRF did not differ between the two groups with SC being the only significant contributor. These results revealed not only between-group differences but also similarities in the relative contributions of PA, OK, and SC to reading fluency at both word and sentence levels, which has practical implications for developing better training programs to improve reading for children with HL.												9	9											APR 12	2021	12								649375	10.3389/fpsyg.2021.649375	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.649375												2026-01-16	WOS:000647441200001
J	Yao, Y; Chen, XX				Yao Yao; Chen Xiaoxiang			The effects of music training on categorical perception of Mandarin tones in 4- to 5-year-old children	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA				Article								Music and speech share many acoustic commonalities and cognitive mechanisms. Previous studies have found that music training can improve categorical perception (CP) of Mandarin tones in adult musicians. However, it remains to be established whether music training can enhance the categorical perception of Mandarin tones in young children and whether the training effects can be influenced by the training duration. The present study used a 2 (group: music training vs no-training) x 3 (test time: pre vs 6-month post vs 12-month post) between-and-within-subjects design to investigate the effects of music training on 4- to 5- year-old children's CP of a Mandarin lexical tone continuum (from Tone 1 to Tone 2). The music training consisted of 110 sessions, 30 minutes per session, and three sessions per week for 12 months involving 20 preschoolers. The children were assigned to two groups, music training group (n = 20, age range from 49.69 months to 51.42 months, SD = 2.91 months) and control group (n = 20, age range from 51.69 to 52.56 months, SD = 3.0 months). In the music training group, the instructor guided children in activities leading to playing the small carillon, while children in the no-training group were given routine class activities. Each session of music training consisted four parts: Part 1 was "listen and sing songs" in which children learned to master notes and focus attention on subtle pitch changes; Part 2 was "listen and discriminate musical notes", children learned to play a single note accurately according to the background music; Part 3 was "listen and play the carillon", children listened to pitch changes in the background music, sang the notes and played the whole song melody; Part 4 was " play the carillon along with actions", children listened to the background music and learned to play the carillon along with simple dancing actions. Children's CP of tone continuum was measured before the learning began, after 6- month and after 12-month training using two tasks (identification test and discrimination test). This study investigated if music training can enhance children's boundary position, boundary width, within-category and between-category discrimination accuracy in CP of Mandarin Tone 1 and Tone 2 through 2 (group: music training vs no-training) x3 (test time: pre vs 6-month post vs 12-month post) repeated measures ANOVA. The results revealed that although the perceptual boundary positions and ability to discriminate between-category tone pairs were unaffected by training, the boundary width values and within-category discrimination accuracies differed significantly between the experimental and control groups. The analysis of boundary width values and within-category discrimination accuracy revealed a significant interaction between group and test time. An analysis of simple effects further indicated that in the pretest and 6-month posttest, there was no significant effect between music training group and no-training group. In the 12-month posttest, the boundary width decreased significantly and the within-category discrimination accuracies increased significantly in the music training group, while no significant differences were found on boundary width and within-category discrimination accuracy in the control group. These results suggest that long-term music training can enhance children's CP of Mandarin tonal contrasts. In conclusion, our results supported the OPERA theory that music training can raise the steepness of boundary widths and enhance children's sensitivity to subtle pitch differences between within-category sounds in the presence of robust mental representation in the service of CP of lexical tonal contrasts.

J	Li, KK; Nguyen, L; Bryant, C; Yoo, K				Li, Katrina Kechun; Nguyen, Li; Bryant, Christopher; Yoo, Kayeon			Lexical tonal effects in code-switching: A comparative study of Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese switching with English	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUALISM				Article								Aims and objectives: Previous research has revealed much about the syntactic and social variables conditioning code-switching (i.e., the alternation between two or more languages in a discourse or utterance); however, little is known about the phonological effects. Our work explores this area by asking two main questions: (1) Does lexical tone affect code-switching between a tonal language and a non-tonal language? and (2) Is this effect (or lack thereof) observable cross-linguistically? Methodology: We examine natural code-switching production between Cantonese and English, Mandarin and English, and Vietnamese and English. We use a semi-automatic natural-language processing method to process and extract relevant variables, including tonal categories at switch points. Data and analysis: Data include transcribed natural speech from three bilingual corpora: the HLVC corpus (Cantonese/English, 25 speakers), the SEAME corpus (Mandarin/English, 20 speakers), and the CanVEC corpus (Vietnamese/English, 45 speakers). We use logistic mixed-effects models to examine tonal effects, taking into account other factors such as frequency and grammatical category. Findings/conclusion: We found a robust tonal effect in Cantonese/English, a less robust effect in Mandarin/English, and no effect in Vietnamese/English. This indicates there is a tonal effect in code-switching between a tonal and a non-tonal language, but this effect is language-dependent. We also found a specific T3 'step-up' pattern at Cantonese-English switch points and offered some possible phonological explanations. Originality: This is the first study that systematically investigates tonal effects in code-switching across different language pairs, using comparable data and methods. Our finding of a Cantonese-English T3 'step-up' pattern is also a novel discovery that hitherto has not been documented. Significance/implications: Theoretically, our findings support Clyne's 'facilitation theory' in code-switching at a prosodic level. Empirically, we nevertheless emphasised the complexity of different prosodic features and social variables in play, thereby rejecting the idea of 'predicting' code-switching solely based on linguistic factors.												3	3											OCT	2024	28	5					799	827		10.1177/13670069231181508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13670069231181508		JUL 2023										2026-01-16	WOS:001037114900001

We have already demonstrated that pitch onset component (Na) of the cortical pitch response (CPR) is sensitive to flat pitch and its salience. In regards to dynamic pitch, we do not yet know whether the multiple pitch-related transient components of the CPR reflect specific temporal attributes of such stimuli. Here we examine the sensitivity of the multiple transient components of CPR to changes in pitch acceleration associated with the Mandarin high rising lexical tone. CPR responses from Chinese listeners were elicited by three citation forms varying in pitch acceleration and duration. Results showed that the pitch onset component (Na) was invariant to changes in acceleration. In contrast, Na-Pb and Pb-Nb showed a systematic increase in the interpeak latency and decrease in amplitude with increase in pitch acceleration that followed the time course of pitch change across the three stimuli. A strong correlation with pitch acceleration was observed for these two components only - a putative index of pitch-relevant neural activity associated with the more rapidly-changing portions of the pitch contour. Pc-Nc marks unambiguously the stimulus offset. We therefore propose that in the early stages of cortical sensory processing, a series of neural markers flag different temporal attributes of a dynamic pitch contour: onset of temporal regularity (Na); changes in temporal regularity between onset and offset (Na-Pb, Pb-Nb); and offset of temporal regularity (Pc-Nc). At the temporal electrode sites, the stimulus with the most gradual change in pitch acceleration evoked a rightward asymmetry. Yet within the left hemisphere, stimuli with more gradual change were indistinguishable. These findings highlight the emergence of early hemispheric preferences and their functional roles as related to sensory and cognitive properties of the stimulus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Escudero, P; Smit, EA; Mulak, KE				Escudero, Paola; Smit, Eline A.; Mulak, Karen E.			Explaining L2 Lexical Learning in Multiple Scenarios: Cross-Situational Word Learning in L1 Mandarin L2 English Speakers	BRAIN SCIENCES				Article								Adults commonly struggle with perceiving and recognizing the sounds and words of a second language (L2), especially when the L2 sounds do not have a counterpart in the learner's first language (L1). We examined how L1 Mandarin L2 English speakers learned pseudo English words within a cross-situational word learning (CSWL) task previously presented to monolingual English and bilingual Mandarin-English speakers. CSWL is ambiguous because participants are not provided with direct mappings of words and object referents. Rather, learners discern word-object correspondences through tracking multiple co-occurrences across learning trials. The monolinguals and bilinguals tested in previous studies showed lower performance for pseudo words that formed vowel minimal pairs (e.g., /dit/-/d?t/) than pseudo word which formed consonant minimal pairs (e.g., /bLATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN On/-/pLATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN On/) or non-minimal pairs which differed in all segments (e.g., /bLATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN On/-/dit/). In contrast, L1 Mandarin L2 English listeners struggled to learn all word pairs. We explain this seemingly contradicting finding by considering the multiplicity of acoustic cues in the stimuli presented to all participant groups. Stimuli were produced in infant-directed-speech (IDS) in order to compare performance by children and adults and because previous research had shown that IDS enhances L1 and L2 acquisition. We propose that the suprasegmental pitch variation in the vowels typical of IDS stimuli might be perceived as lexical tone distinctions for tonal language speakers who cannot fully inhibit their L1 activation, resulting in high lexical competition and diminished learning during an ambiguous word learning task. Our results are in line with the Second Language Linguistic Perception (L2LP) model which proposes that fine-grained acoustic information from multiple sources and the ability to switch between language modes affects non-native phonetic and lexical development.												11	12											DEC	2022	12	12							1618	10.3390/brainsci12121618	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12121618												2026-01-16	WOS:000900592500001
J	Wong, P; Lam, KY				Wong, Puisan; Lam, Ka Yu			Characteristics of Effective Auditory Training: Implications From Two Training Programs That Successfully Trained Nonnative Cantonese Tone Identification in Monolingual Mandarin and Bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese Tone Speakers	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH				Article								Purpose: Auditory training is important in pedagogical and clinical settings. In search of a more effective perceptual program for training new suprasegmental categories, this study examined the effect of two auditory programs that incorporated five elements that have previously been identified to be effective for training nonnative segmental and suprasegmental speech sounds on the identification of a complex foreign lexical tone system (Cantonese) that contrasts both pitch shapes and pitch heights. To investigate the training outcomes in learners with different tonal systems, monolingual Mandarin-speaking learners who have a smaller native tonal system that contrasts pitch shapes only and bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese-speaking learners who have a larger native tonal system that contrasts both pitch shapes and pitch heights were recruited for training. Method: Thirty Mandarin-speaking monolinguals and 33 Mandarin-Taiwanese-speaking bilinguals in Taiwan were randomly assigned to two training programs, one with different tones and the other with the same tone preceding the target words in the same training block, and received six 90-min training sessions within 2 weeks. They took a Cantonese Tone Identification Test before training and after each training session. Twenty Cantonese native speakers in Hong Kong served as the reference group and took the same Cantonese Tone Identification Test. Results: The two training programs were equally effective. Before training, the monolinguals performed poorer than the bilinguals. After training, the monolinguals and bilinguals in both training programs identified the six Cantonese tones in new words, new utterances, and novel speakers with comparable results, and their overall accuracy did not differ from that of the Cantonese native speakers. Conclusions: Though learners with a larger and more complex native tonal system have initial advantage in learning nonnative tones, the intensive high- variability full-set training programs that provide explicit phonetic instruction and contrastive feedback of nonnative tones effectively promote nonnative tone acquisition in learners of different tone languages. The findings revealed factors affecting nonnative tone acquisition in tone speakers. The design of the two programs can be adopted in future programs for effective auditory training of segmental and suprasegmental speech sounds.												6	7											JUL	2021	64	7					2490	2512		10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00436												2026-01-16	WOS:000693445900006
J	Kaan, E; Barkley, CM; Bao, M; Wayland, R				Kaan, Edith; Barkley, Christopher M.; Bao, Mingzhen; Wayland, Ratree			Thai lexical tone perception in native speakers of Thai, English and Mandarin Chinese: An event-related potentials training study	BMC NEUROSCIENCE				Article								Background: Tone languages such as Thai and Mandarin Chinese use differences in fundamental frequency (F-0, pitch) to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that native speakers of a non-tone language have difficulty discriminating among tone contrasts and are sensitive to different F-0 dimensions than speakers of a tone language. The aim of the present ERP study was to investigate the effect of language background and training on the non-attentive processing of lexical tones. EEG was recorded from 12 adult native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, 12 native speakers of American English, and 11 Thai speakers while they were watching a movie and were presented with multiple tokens of low-falling, mid-level and high-rising Thai lexical tones. High-rising or low-falling tokens were presented as deviants among mid-level standard tokens, and vice versa. EEG data and data from a behavioral discrimination task were collected before and after a two-day perceptual categorization training task. Results: Behavioral discrimination improved after training in both the Chinese and the English groups. Low-falling tone deviants versus standards elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN) in all language groups. Before, but not after training, the English speakers showed a larger MMN compared to the Chinese, even though English speakers performed worst in the behavioral tasks. The MMN was followed by a late negativity, which became smaller with improved discrimination. The High-rising deviants versus standards elicited a late negativity, which was left-lateralized only in the English and Chinese groups. Conclusion: Results showed that native speakers of English, Chinese and Thai recruited largely similar mechanisms when non-attentively processing Thai lexical tones. However, native Thai speakers differed from the Chinese and English speakers with respect to the processing of late F-0 contour differences (high-rising versus mid-level tones). In addition, native speakers of a non-tone language (English) were initially more sensitive to F-0 onset differences (low-falling versus mid-level contrast), which was suppressed as a result of training. This result converges with results from previous behavioral studies and supports the view that attentive as well as non-attentive processing of F-0 contrasts is affected by language background, but is malleable even in adult learners.												50	66											JUN 23	2008	9								53	10.1186/1471-2202-9-53	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-9-53												2026-01-16	WOS:000258350400001
J	Zahner-Ritter, K; Zhao, TY; Einfeldt, M; Braun, B				Zahner-Ritter, Katharina; Zhao, Tianyi; Einfeldt, Marieke; Braun, Bettina			How experience with tone in the native language affects the L2 acquisition of pitch accents	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This paper tested the ability of Mandarin learners of German, whose native language has lexical tone, to imitate pitch accent contrasts in German, an intonation language. In intonation languages, pitch accents do not convey lexical information; also, pitch accents are sparser than lexical tones as they only associate with prominent words in the utterance. We compared two kinds of German pitch-accent contrasts: (1) a "non-merger" contrast, which Mandarin listeners perceive as different and (2) a "merger" contrast, which sounds more similar to Mandarin listeners. Speakers of a tone language are generally very sensitive to pitch. Hypothesis 1 (H1) therefore stated that Mandarin learners produce the two kinds of contrasts similarly to native German speakers. However, the documented sensitivity to tonal contrasts, at the expense of processing phrase-level intonational contrasts, may generally hinder target-like production of intonational pitch accents in the L2 (Hypothesis 2, H2). Finally, cross-linguistic influence (CLI) predicts a difference in the realization of these two contrasts as well as improvement with higher proficiency (Hypothesis 3, H3). We used a delayed imitation paradigm, which is well-suited for assessing L2-phonetics and -phonology because it does not necessitate access to intonational meaning. We investigated the imitation of three kinds of accents, which were associated with the sentence-final noun in short wh-questions (e.g., Wer malt denn Mandalas, lit: "Who draws PRT mandalas?" "Who likes drawing mandalas?"). In Experiment 1, 28 native speakers of Mandarin participated (14 low- and 14 high-proficient). The learners' productions of the two kinds of contrasts were analyzed using General Additive Mixed Models to evaluate differences in pitch accent contrasts over time, in comparison to the productions of native German participants from an earlier study in our lab. Results showed a more pronounced realization of the non-merger contrast compared to German natives and a less distinct realization of the merger contrast, with beneficial effects of proficiency, lending support to H3. Experiment 2 tested low-proficient Italian learners of German (whose L1 is an intonation language) to contextualize the Mandarin data and further investigate CLI. Italian learners realized the non-merger contrast more target-like than Mandarin learners, lending additional support to CLI (H3).												5	6											AUG 19	2022	13								903879	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903879												2026-01-16	WOS:000861273800001
