J	Singh, L; Chee, M				Singh, Leher; Chee, Melissa			Rise and fall: Effects of tone and intonation on spoken word recognition in early childhood	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								A crucial component of word learning is the ability to recognize words in spite of the varying forms they assume. This may be particularly challenging in tone languages as learners have to develop tone representations in the face of intonational variation in order to accurately recognize words. The effects of intonational variation on word recognition of tone-marked words in Mandarin Chinese were investigated in toddlers and preschoolers using a cross-sectional design. Participants were presented with known words where intonation (question/statement) and tone (rising/falling) were independently manipulated. Results demonstrated that word recognition in toddlers was heavily influenced by changes in the pitch contour of a tone due to intonational variation. In contrast, preschool were able to recognize tone-marked words regardless of simultaneous intonational variation, demonstrating a comparatively robust representation of lexical tone. Results chart an evolution in integrating pitch cues to tone and intonation over the first few years of life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kung, C; Chwilla, DJ; Schriefers, H				Kung, Carmen; Chwilla, Dorothee J.; Schriefers, Herbert			The interaction of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context in on-line spoken word recognition: An ERP study on Cantonese Chinese	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA				Article								In two ERP experiments, we investigate the on-line interplay of lexical tone, intonation and semantic context during spoken word recognition in Cantonese Chinese. Experiment 1 shows that lexical tone and intonation interact immediately. Words with a low lexical tone at the end of questions (with a rising question intonation) lead to a processing conflict. This is reflected in a low accuracy in lexical identification and in a P600 effect compared to the same words at the end of a statement. Experiment 2 shows that a strongly biasing semantic context leads to much better lexical-identification performance for words with a low tone at the end of questions and to a disappearance of the P600 effect. These results support the claim that semantic context plays a major role in disentangling the tonal information from the intonational information, and thus, in resolving the on-line conflict between intonation and tone. However, the ERP data indicate that the introduction of a semantic context does not entirely eliminate on-line processing problems for words at the end of questions. This is revealed by the presence of an N400 effect for words with a low lexical tone and for words with a high-mid lexical tone at the end of questions. The ERP data thus show that, while semantic context helps in the eventual lexical identification, it makes the deviation of the contextually expected lexical tone from the actual acoustic signal more salient.

J	Liu, M; Chen, YY; Schiller, NO				Liu, Min; Chen, Yiya; Schiller, Niels O.			Context Matters for Tone and Intonation Processing in Mandarin	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								In tonal languages such as Mandarin, both lexical tone and sentence intonation are primarily signaled by F0. Their F0 encodings are sometimes in conflict and sometimes in congruency. The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that top-down information provided by the semantically constraining context can play a facilitating role for listeners to disentangle intonational information from tonal information, but mainly in sentences with the lexical falling tone in the final position.												6	6											MAR	2022	65	1					52	72	0023830920986174	10.1177/0023830920986174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830920986174		JAN 2021										2026-01-16	WOS:000618452600001

Evidence in Dutch suggests that the timing of simple up-and-down, non-referential "beat" gestures influences spoken word recognition: the same auditory stimulus was perceived as CONtent (noun, capitalized letters indicate stressed syllables) when a beat gesture occurred on the first syllable, but as conTENT (adjective) when the gesture occurred on the second syllable. However, these findings were based on a small number of minimal pairs in Dutch, limiting the generalizability of the findings. We therefore tested this effect in Spanish, where lexical stress is highly relevant in the verb conjugation system, distinguishing bailo, "I dance" with word-initial stress from bail & oacute;, "she danced" with word-final stress. Testing a larger sample (N = 100), we also assessed whether individual differences in working memory capacity modulated how much individuals relied on the gestures in spoken word recognition. The results showed that, similar to Dutch, Spanish participants were biased to perceive lexical stress on the syllable that visually co-occurred with a beat gesture, with the effect being strongest when the acoustic stress cues were most ambiguous. No evidence was found for by-participant effect sizes to be influenced by individual differences in phonological or visuospatial working memory. These findings reveal gestural-speech coordination impacts lexical stress perception in a language where listeners are regularly confronted with such lexical stress contrasts, highlighting the impact of gestures' timing on prominence perception and spoken word recognition.												2	2											OCT	2025	32	5					2136	2145		10.3758/s13423-025-02683-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-025-02683-9		APR 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001461194700001

Whether or not this notion generalises across languages remains, however, unclear. Particularly, tonal languages are an interesting test case because of the dual linguistic function of pitch that conveys lexical meaning in form of tone, in addition to intonation. To date, only few studies have explored how intonation is processed in tonal languages, how this compares to tone and between tonal and non-tonal language speakers. The present fMRI study addressed these questions by testing Mandarin and German speakers with Mandarin material. Both groups categorised mono-syllabic Mandarin words in terms of intonation, tone, and voice gender. Systematic comparisons of brain activity of the two groups between the three tasks showed large cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural processing of intonation in left fronto-parietal, right frontal, and bilateral cingulo-opercular regions. These areas are associated with general phonological, specific prosodic, and controlled categorical decision-making processes, respectively. Tone processing overlapped with intonation processing in left fronto-parietal areas, in both groups, but evoked additional activity in bilateral temporo-parietal semantic regions and subcortical areas in Mandarin speakers only. Together, these findings confirm cross-linguistic commonalities in the neural implementation of intonation processing but dissociations for semantic processing of tone only in tonal language speakers.												27	28											MAY	2020	41	7					1842	1858		10.1002/hbm.24916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24916		JAN 2020										2026-01-16	WOS:000508026600001

When is a Question a Question for Children and Adults?	LANGUAGE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT				Article								Terminal changes in fundamental frequency provide the most salient acoustic cues to declarative questions, but adults sometimes identify such questions from pre-terminal cues. In the present study, adults and 7- to 10-year-old children judged a single speaker's adult-and child-directed utterances as questions or statements in a gating task with word-length increments. Listeners of all ages successfully used pre-terminal cues to identify utterance type, often only the initial word, and they were more accurate for child-directed than adult-directed utterances. There were age-related differences in identification accuracy and number of words required for correct identification. Age differences were already apparent on the initial {first five) utterances, confirming adults' superior explicit knowledge of intonation patterns that signify questions and statements. Adults' performance improved over the course of the test session, reflecting taker-specific learning, but children exhibited no such learning.												8	10												2017	13	3					274	285		10.1080/15475441.2016.1252681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2016.1252681												2026-01-16	WOS:000418529200004

Although neurophysiological data has shown that communicative functions conveyed through prosody are processed rapidly in the human brain, it is still unclear when and to what extent prosodic information is needed for the conscious speech act recognition as speech unfolds. Using a gating paradigm, we investigated the point at which listeners recognise the function of identical Italian sentences - whether they express a question or statement - based on vocal intonation. Comparing cross-spliced and natural sentences, we found that, rising or falling nuclear accentual movement on the sentence-final word seems to be the primary cue for recognition, with questions identified slightly later than statements. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of splicing techniques in filtering out natural prosodic variations, the presence of a "statement bias" in perceiving incomplete sentences, along with a visual examination of interindividual responses. These findings offer valuable insights into the timing of conscious recognition of different communicative functions based on speech prosody.												3	4											SEP 14	2025	40	8					1065	1084		10.1080/23273798.2025.2506641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2025.2506641		MAY 2025										2026-01-16	WOS:001503007800001
J	Zou, T; Caspers, J; Chen, YY				Zou, Ting; Caspers, Johanneke; Chen, Yiya			Perception of Different Tone Contrasts at Sub-Lexical and Lexical Levels by Dutch Learners of Mandarin Chinese	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				Article								This study explores the difficulties in distinguishing different lexical tone contrasts at both sub-lexical and lexical levels for beginning and advanced Dutch learners of Mandarin, using a sequence-recall task and an auditory lexical decision task. In both tasks, the Tone 2-Tone 3 contrast is most prone to errors for both groups of learners. A significant improvement in the advanced group was found for this tone contrast in the sub-lexical sequence recall task, but not in the lexical decision task. This is taken as evidence that utilizing tones in on-line spoken word recognition is more complex and demanding for L2 learners than in a memory-based task. The results of the lexical decision task also revealed that advanced learners have developed a stronger sensitivity to Tone 1 compared to the other three tones, with Tone 4 showing the least sensitivity. These findings suggest different levels of robustness and distinctiveness for the representation of different lexical tones in L2 learners' lexicon and consequently different levels of proficiency in integrating tones for lexical processing. The observed patterns of difficulty are potentially related to the acoustic characteristics of different lexical tone contrasts as well as to the interference of the suprasegmental features of learner's native language (i.e., the tonal contrasts of Dutch intonation) on the acquisition of the Mandarin lexical tone contrasts.												3	3											JUN 6	2022	13								891756	10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891756												2026-01-16	WOS:000813299300001
J	Mattys, SL				Mattys, SL			The perception of primary and secondary stress in English	PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS				Article								Most models of word recognition concerned with prosody are based on a distinction between strong syllables (containing a full vowel) and weak syllables (containing a schwa). In these models,the posslibility that listeners take advantage of finer grained prosodic distinctions, such as primary versus secondary stress, is usually rejected on the grounds that these two categories are not discriminable from each other without lexical information or normalization of the speaker's voice. In the present experiment, subjects were presented with word fragments that differed only by their degree of stress-namely, primary or secondary stress (e.g., /'prasi/ vs. /"prasi/). The task was to guess the origin of the fragment (e.g., "prosecutor" vs. "prosecution"). The results showed that guessing performance: significantly exceeds the chance level, which indicates that making fine stress distinctions is possible without lexical information and with minimal speech normalization This finding is discussed in the framework of prosody-based word recognition theories.												52	59											FEB	2000	62	2					253	265		10.3758/BF03205547	http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03205547												2026-01-16	WOS:000085653500002
J	Zahner, K; Kutscheid, S; Braun, B				Zahner, Katharina; Kutscheid, Sophie; Braun, Bettina			Alignment of f0 peak in different pitch accent types affects perception of metrical stress	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								In intonation languages, pitch accents are associated with stressed syllables, therefore accentuation is a sufficient cue to the position of metrical stress in perception. This paper investigates how stress perception in German is affected by different pitch accent types (with different f0 alignments). Experiment 1 showed more errors in stress identification when f0 peaks and stressed syllables were not aligned - despite phonological association of pitch accent and stressed syllable. Erroneous responses revealed a response bias towards the syllable with the f0 peak. In a visual-world eye-tracking study (Experiment 2), listeners fixated a stress competitor with initial stress more when the spoken target, which had penultimate stress, was realized with an early-peak accent (f0 peak preceding stressed syllable), compared to a condition with the f0 peak on the stressed syllable. Hence, high-pitched unstressed syllables are temporarily interpreted as stressed - a process directly affecting lexical activation. To investigate whether this stress competitor activation is guided by the frequent co-occurrence of high f0 and lexical stress, Experiment 3 increased the frequency of low-pitched stressed syllables in the immediate input. The effect of intonation on competitor fixations disappeared. Our findings are discussed with respect to a frequency-based mechanism and their implications for the nature of f0 processing.

J	Sano, S; Guillemot, C				Sano, Shin-ichiro; Guillemot, Celeste			Contrast enhancement and the distribution of vowel duration in Japanese	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS				Article								This paper offers a case study of the role of information in patterns of segmental duration, focusing on the short vs. long vowel contrast in Japanese. We confirmed that the position of vowels in linguistic units (intonation phrase/IP and word) and the length of the units affect vowel duration, but the patterns differ depending on the type of units. The results suggest that at the word level, vowel duration patterns in such a way that cues for vowel contrast are enhanced in salient (earlier) positions and units with less predictability or more lexical competitors (shorter words), while cues are relatively reduced in non-salient (later) positions and units with more predictability or less lexical competitors (longer words). In this way, the variation in vowel duration balances the successful transmission of lexical information and the cost for phonetic implementation, which supports previous findings in communication-based approaches of language.<br /> (c) 2024 The Author(s).

For each participant, the character set was subdivided into more and less familiar talkers based on the participant's ability to name each character. Four- and 5-year-old children recognized more of the voices (81% and 86%, respectively) than did 3-year-olds (61%), although performance of all age groups was well above chance. All groups of children were more accurate at recognizing more familiar than less familiar characters. These results suggest that indexical information about a talker becomes an integral part of the perceptual record in memory and can be used by children at a very young age. These results are important because children's ability to learn vocal sources may be an important aid to the development of spoken word recognition.												36	45											FEB	2002	45	1					214	222		10.1044/1092-4388(2002/016)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2002/016)												2026-01-16	WOS:000173812500016

We present two experiments that employed a gating paradigm to investigate emotional prosody. In Experiment 1, participants heard successively building segments of Jabberwocky osentenceso spoken with happy, angry, or neutral intonation. After each segment, participants indicated the emotion conveyed and rated their confidence in their decision. Participants in Experiment 2 also heard Jabberwocky osentenceso in successive increments, with half discriminating happy from neutral prosody, and half discriminating angry from neutral prosody. Participants in both experiments identified neutral prosody more rapidly and accurately than happy or angry prosody. Confidence ratings were greater for neutral sentences, and error patterns also indicated a bias for recognising neutral prosody. Taken together, results suggest that enhanced processing of emotional content may be constrained by stimulus modality.												20	24												2010	24	7					1133	1152	PII 927614767	10.1080/02699930903247492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699930903247492												2026-01-16	WOS:000282580800004
J	Newman, R; Chatterjee, M				Newman, Rochelle; Chatterjee, Monita			Toddlers' recognition of noise-vocoded speech	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								Despite their remarkable clinical success, cochlear-implant listeners today still receive spectrally degraded information. Much research has examined normally hearing adult listeners' ability to interpret spectrally degraded signals, primarily using noise-vocoded speech to simulate cochlear implant processing. Far less research has explored infants' and toddlers' ability to interpret spectrally degraded signals, despite the fact that children in this age range are frequently implanted. This study examines 27-month-old typically developing toddlers' recognition of noise-vocoded speech in a language-guided looking study. Children saw two images on each trial and heard a voice instructing them to look at one item ("Find the cat!"). Full-spectrum sentences or their noise-vocoded versions were presented with varying numbers of spectral channels. Toddlers showed equivalent proportions of looking to the target object with full-speech and 24- or 8-channel noise-vocoded speech; they failed to look appropriately with 2-channel noise-vocoded speech and showed variable performance with 4-channel noise-vocoded speech. Despite accurate looking performance for speech with at least eight channels, children were slower to respond appropriately as the number of channels decreased. These results indicate that 2-yr-olds have developed the ability to interpret vocoded speech, even without practice, but that doing so requires additional processing. These findings have important implications for pediatric cochlear implantation. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

J	Wu, ZH; Ortega-Llebaria, M				Wu, Zhaohong; Ortega-Llebaria, Marta			Pitch shape modulates the time course of tone vs pitch-accent identification in Mandarin Chinese	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				Article								In Mandarin Chinese pitch is used to express both lexical meanings via tones and sentence-level meanings via pitch-accents raising the question of which information is processed first. While research with meaningful sentence materials suggested a general processing advantage of tone over pitch-accents, research on pure tones and nonce speech in pre-attentive processing found that the f0-shape led to timing and site processing differences. The current study reconciles these results by exploring whether the tone advantage found in meaningful speech materials is modulated by the f0-shape by establishing via a gating paradigm the relative timing of tone and pitch-accent identification. Target words containing static (T1) and dynamic (T2, T4) tones were embedded into meaningful sentences and were divided into 50 ms gates which were added incrementally either from the left-or right-edge of the target word. Results showed that dynamic targets had either a tone or pitch-accent advantage contingent on the direction of gate processing. In contrast, for static T1 targets, tone and pitch-accent were identified simultaneously regardless of the direction of gate processing. Altogether, these results indicate that the f0-shape, as defined by pitch dimensions of f0 and pitch range, mediates the timing of tone and pitch-accent identification in meaningful speech supporting highly interactive models of speech perception.

Using prosody to avoid ambiguity: Effects of speaker awareness and referential context. Journal of Memory and Language, 48, 103-130]. Wh-in-situ questions contain temporary syntactic ambiguity. One of the languages characterised by wh-in-situ questions is Persian. The current research adopted the gating paradigm [Grosjean, 1980. Spoken word recognition processes and the gating paradigm.

A perception experiment was designed in which gated stimuli were played to Persian native speakers in a forced-choice sentence identification task. In line with our expectation, correct identification responses were given from the beginning of the sentence.

J	Ma, WY; Zhou, P; Singh, L; Gao, LQ				Ma, Weiyi; Zhou, Peng; Singh, Leher; Gao, Liqun			Spoken word recognition in young tone language learners: Age-dependent effects of segmental and suprasegmental variation	COGNITION				Article								The majority of the world's languages rely on both segmental (vowels, consonants) and suprasegmental (lexical tones) information to contrast the meanings of individual words. However, research on early language development has mostly focused on the acquisition of vowel-consonant languages. Developmental research comparing sensitivity to segmental and suprasegmental features in young tone learners is extremely rare. This study examined 2- and 3-year-old monolingual tone learners' sensitivity to vowels and tones. Experiment la tested the influence of vowel and tone variation on novel word learning. Vowel and tone variation hindered word recognition efficiency in both age groups. However, tone variation hindered word recognition accuracy only in 2-year-olds, while 3-year-olds were insensitive to tone variation. Experiment 1b demonstrated that 3-year-olds could use tones to learn new words when additional support was provided, and additionally, that Tone 3 words were exceptionally difficult to learn. Experiment 2 confirmed a similar pattern of results when children were presented with familiar words. This study is the first to show that despite the importance of tones in tone languages, vowels maintain primacy over tones in young children's word recognition and that tone sensitivity in word learning and recognition changes between 2 and 3 years of age. The findings suggest that early lexical processes are more tightly constrained by variation in vowels than by tones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Influence of Tonal and Atonal Bilingualism on Children's Lexical and Non-Lexical Tone Perception	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH				Article								This study examined how bilingualism in an atonal language, in addition to a tonal language, influences lexical and non-lexical tone perception and word learning during childhood. Forty children aged 5;3-7;2, bilingual either in English and Mandarin or English and another atonal language, were tested on Mandarin lexical tone discrimination, level-pitch sine-wave tone discrimination, and learning of novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone. Mandarin-English bilingual children discriminated between and learned novel words differing minimally in Mandarin lexical tone more accurately than their atonal-English bilingual peers. However, Mandarin-English and atonal-English bilingual children discriminated between level-pitch sine-wave tones with similar accuracy. Moreover, atonal-English bilingual children showed a tendency to perceive differing Mandarin lexical and level-pitch sine-wave tones as identical, whereas their Mandarin-English peers showed no such tendency. These results indicate that bilingualism in a tonal language in addition to an atonal language-but not bilingualism in two atonal languages-allows for continued sensitivity to lexical tone beyond infancy. Moreover, they suggest that although tonal-atonal bilingualism does not enhance sensitivity to differences in pitch between sine-wave tones beyond infancy any more effectively than atonal-atonal bilingualism, it protects against the development of biases to perceive differing lexical and non-lexical tones as identical. Together, the results indicate that, beyond infancy, tonal-atonal bilinguals process lexical tones using different cognitive mechanisms than atonal-atonal bilinguals, but that both groups process level-pitch non-lexical tone using the same cognitive mechanisms.												7	8											JUN	2020	63	2					221	241		10.1177/0023830919834679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830919834679												2026-01-16	WOS:000537760600002
J	Tang, P; Yuen, I; Demuth, K; Rattanasone, NX				Tang, Ping; Yuen, Ivan; Demuth, Katherine; Rattanasone, Nan Xu			The Acquisition of Contrastive Focus During Online Sentence-Comprehension by Children Learning Mandarin Chinese	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Contrastive focus, conveyed by prosodic cues, marks important information. Studies have shown that 6-year-olds learning English and Japanese can use contrastive focus during online sentence comprehension: focus used in a contrastive context facilitates the identification of a target referent (speeding up processing), whereas focus used inappropriately in a noncontrastive context misleads listeners to predict an incorrect referent, hindering the identification process (Ito et al., 2012, 2014). In Mandarin Chinese, the mapping between prosodic form and contrastive focus is less transparent, potentially delaying the acquisition of contrastive focus. This study assessed the online processing of contrastive focus by 196 Mandarin-speaking 4-10-year-olds and 34 adults in China, using the visual world paradigm. Stimuli contained a target NP in a mini discourse, with focus being used in contrastive (Experiment 1) versus Noncontrastive contexts (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that the appropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus facilitated the identification of a target referent for 7-10-year-olds and adults, though not younger children. Experiment 2 showed that the inappropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus slowed the identification process only for 10-year-olds and adults. Thus, whereas 7-10-year-olds are sensitive to prosodic form for contrastive focus, only 10-year-olds use it as a primary cue to predict an upcoming referent like adults. The acquisition of contrastive focus in Mandarin is therefore a gradual process, with children showing sensitivity to contrastive focus during the early school years, and developing adult-like form-function mapping between prosody and focus until the end of primary school.												6	6											MAY	2023	59	5					845	861		10.1037/dev0001498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001498		DEC 2022										2026-01-16	WOS:000894788700001

Developmental change in tone perception in Mandarin monolingual, English monolingual, and Mandarin-English bilingual infants: Divergences between monolingual and bilingual learners	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY				Article								Most languages use lexical tone to discriminate the meanings of words. There has been recent interest in tracking the development of tone categories during infancy. These studies have focused largely on monolingual infants learning either a tone language or a non-tone language. It remains to be seen how bilingual infants learning one tone language (e.g., Mandarin) and one non-tone language (e.g., English) discriminate tones. Here, we examined infants' discrimination of two Mandarin tones pairs: one salient and one subtle. Discrimination was investigated in three groups: Mandarin-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and Mandarin monolinguals at 6 months and 9 months of age in a cross-sectional design. Results demonstrated relatively strong Mandarin tone discrimination in Mandarin monolinguals, with salient tone discrimination at 6 months and both salient and subtle tone discrimination at 9 months. English monolinguals discriminated neither contrast at 6 months but discriminated the salient contrast at 9 months. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for tone discrimination in Mandarin-English bilingual infants. In a second experiment, 12- and 13-month-old Mandarin-English bilingual and English monolingual infants were tested to determine whether bilinguals would demonstrate tone sensitivity at a later age. Results revealed a lack of tone sensitivity at 12 or 13 months in bilingual infants, yet English monolingual infants were sensitive to both salient and subtle Mandarin tone contrasts at 12 or 13 months. Our findings provide evidence for age-related convergence in Mandarin tone discrimination in English and Mandarin monolingual infants and for a distinct pattern of tone discrimination in bilingual infants. Theoretical implications for phonetic category acquisition are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

J	Armstrong, ME; Andreu, L; Esteve-Gibert, N; Prieto, P				Armstrong, Meghan E.; Andreu, Llorenc; Esteve-Gibert, Nuria; Prieto, Pilar			Children's processing of morphosyntactic and prosodic cues in overriding context-based hypotheses: an eye tracking study	PROBUS				Article								This research explores children's ability to integrate contextual and linguistic cues. Prior work has shown that children are not able to weigh contextual information in an adult-like way and that between the age of 4 and 6 they show difficulties in revising a hypothesis they have made based on early-arriving linguistic information in sentence processing. Therefore we considered children's ability to confirm or override a context-based hypothesis based on linguistic information. Our objective in this study was to test (1) children's (ages 4-6) ability to form a hypothesis based on contextual information, (2) their ability to override such a hypothesis based on linguistic information and (3) how children are able to use different types of linguistic cues (morphosyntactic versus prosodic) to confirm or override the initial hypothesis. Results from both offline (pointing) and online (eye tracking) tasks suggest that children in this age group indeed form hypotheses based on contextual information. Age effects were found regarding children's ability to override these hypotheses. Overall, 4-year-olds were not shown to be able to override their hypotheses using linguistic information of interest. For 5- and 6-year-olds, it depended on the types of linguistic cues that were available to them. Children were better at using morphosyntactic cues to override an initial hypothesis than they were at using prosodic cues to do so. Our results suggest that children slowly develop the ability to override hypotheses based on early-arriving information, even when that information is extralinguistic and contextual. Children must learn to weight different types of cues in an adult-like way. This developmental period of learning to prioritize different cues in an adult-like way is consistent with a constraint-based model of learning.												6	7											MAY	2016	28	1			SI		57	90		10.1515/probus-2016-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/probus-2016-0004												2026-01-16	WOS:000375180700004
