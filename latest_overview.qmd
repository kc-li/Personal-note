## Projects ongoing

### Mandarin question in laboratory phonology

-   Focus: Establish the tone–intonation relationship using traditional laboratory phonology approaches, with particular emphasis on variability in realisation.

-   Serves as the foundation for further perception-related investigations. (Lit Review ongoing)

-   Current status:

    -   Original 8 people, using PCA for f0 alone
        -   TAI proceeding paper, LabPhon abstract (late Jan/Feb)
    -   New recording done till 15 people, perhaps adding 1 more speaker(?)
    -   LIBC intern students in the process of checking annotation
        -   In the process of marking three time points: syllable start; rhyme start; ending
        -   Upcoming meeting: 2025-01-15, plan for talking about extracting data and check filter f0 qualities

-   Some 'side-products' out of this:

    -   Manual for segmentation (specifically for this task, but could potentially be expanded with other user cases)
    -   Customizable praat script facilitating checking process
    -   ShinyAPP to check f0 outliers, either by contour or fPCA data (in developement)

-   Next steps:

    -   Finish the interactive scripts marking (by Jan 15)
    -   Finish the new dataset annotation and analysis (by Jan 31)
    -   Start to think of the article
        -   Use the collaborative dataset to explore patterns of variation through both parametric and non-parametric methods

### Mandarin non-canonical questions (handbook & experiment)

-   Focus: Investigate how prosody reflects subtle contextual differences across subtypes of question intonation, and how these interact with different morphosyntactic forms.
-   Zoom in on a specific question type
-   strand 1: Handbook
    -   A theoretical framework review
-   Current status:
    -   Draft of handbook chapter almost done
    -   Experiment materials ready, improving the design
-   Next steps:
    -   Finalise the chapter in the coming weeks.
    -   Finalise the experimental design in November; begin data collection in December.

## Projects planing

-   Perception of intonation (eye-tracking): how listeners process variability in intonation, how intonation variation influences tone identification, the role of contextual cues and predictive processing, etc.
    -   Current status:
        -   Tonal/Word identification (with different intonation & semantic context) experiment plan not good (?)
    -   Plan: Think through in December

### Mandarin question in corpus (put on hold)

-   Focus: Investigate intonation patterns in real life questions and tone–intonation interactions (in spontaneous, and theatrical speech)
-   Current status:
    -   Basic processing of MagicData spontaneous corpus
    -   Identified three types of particle questions and their associative contexts, poster Dag van de Fonetiek
-   Plan(?):
    -   LLM for context marking
    -   improve f0 data quality (more robust checking procedure)
    -   Theatrical speech

## Individual variation

Individual difference is important - how did we achieve the meaning?

Think of the metaphor of perceiving a segment -

## My keywords

-   Mental representation

-   Individual variation vs. normalisation
